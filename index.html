  <p>This is a description of a very sophisticated phishing scam that almost caught a professional unawares. I have to admit, I might also have been caught up in this if I was in the author’s shoes. This is why two-factor authentication is so important. A username and password combination is just too easy to break these days.</p>

  </h4>

  <p>My latest keyboard experiment is by the same group that made the <a href="/2016/06/03/ergodox-keyboard/">Infinity ErgoDox keyboard</a> I talked about a while back. It is called the <a href="https://input.club/devices/infinity-keyboard">Infinity 60% Keyboard</a>. There are three commonly-accepted sizes of keyboards for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full-size - the typical 104-key layout with the main keyboard, F-keys, full-sized arrow and navigation keys and a numeric keypad</li>
<li>
<a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Tenkeyless_keyboard">Tenkeyless</a> - This is the same as the full size keyboard but the section containing the numeric keypad chopped off</li>
<li>
<a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25">60%</a> - a layout with just the main keyboard and nothing else, not even F-keys</li>
</ul>

<p>There are plenty of other less common layouts and there are even variations in categories, but these are the main ones. Here’s a picture of my 60% keyboard:</p>

<p><a href="/images/infinity-60-percent.jpg" data-lightbox="My Infinity 60% Keyboard" data-title="My Infinity 60% Keyboard"><img src="/images/infinity-60-percent.jpg" alt="My Infinity 60% Keyboard" width="100%"></a></p>

<p>What keyboard enthusiasts like about the smaller keyboards vary from person to person, but common reasons I’ve heard are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Smaller keyboards take up less desk space</li>
<li>Getting rid of the extra keys is more efficient because it forces you to use more key combinations so your hands move less</li>
<li>It’s challenging and fun to learn new keyboard layouts</li>
<li>Smaller keyboards can be taken traveling more easily meaning that <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenteinum/27920424870">one never has to type on an inferior keyboard</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I wasn’t interested in the Infinity 60% for the challenge or even necessarily the small size. I liked the idea of it because it, like the ErgoDox, is fully programmable. I can completely rework the way the keyboard operates and even create special functions or macros. For example, when I hold down the Caps Lock key, the blue, green, orange, and red buttons in the upper right become media keys: Mute, Play/Pause, Volume Down, and Volume Up respectively. This way, I can make the keyboard work best for me … not conform myself to the keyboard.</p>

<p>And yeah, I may try out the keyboard on the road the next time I go traveling …</p>

  <p>This is provably untrue. One of the most commonly-used symmetric encryption algorithms, the Advanced Encryption Standard or AES, was originally known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">Rijndael</a>. Why was it called that? Because it was invented by two Belgian cryptographers.</p>

  <p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed in a hearing that, “In this smartphone, almost everything came from federal investments in research … Federal research invented it.” That’s a pretty big leap, going from funding research in individual components to claiming sole responsibility for inventing a specific configuration of technologies. I will concede that federally-funded research made <em>the smartphone</em> possible, though not necessarily the iPhone. Just like I will freely state that federally-funded research made the modern Internet possible. But to utterly discount and devalue the blood, sweat and tears that hundreds and thousands of inventors, craftspeople, software developers, designers, factory workers and many, many others have contributed is pure, unabashed arrogance.</p>

<p>Do you know what makes federally-funded research possible? Taxpayers.</p>

  <p>Another person I work with at <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers">Brandon Keepers</a>, is working on a talk about the relationship between community participation and careers. He’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/bkeepers/b3bffa5b5d66f61a58f66c7cfddbca0a">asked a few questions</a> of people who feel that open source has impacted their career. Since I feel I fall into that camp, I wanted to answer his questions and felt that others might be interested in my answers … so here they are!</p>

<p><strong>Q: What impact has participation in open source had on your career?</strong></p>

<p>I got my current job as the Community Manager of the <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom">Atom</a> and <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron">Electron</a> projects at GitHub directly from my work with Atom’s community and contributing to the Atom project.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How did you first get exposed to open source, and what attracted you to learning more about it?</strong></p>

<p>Honestly, I can’t remember exactly what first exposed me to open source. It was probably some piece of BBS-support software that I used to run my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat!_BBS">Wildcat! BBS</a> in the very early 1990s. At the time, it was simply a means to an end.</p>

<p>As far as learning more about it, in the late-1990s you couldn’t be a professional software developer without having some familiarity with what open source was. Since I was supporting a family of five on my single income, I felt at the time that traditional commercial software was more aligned with my goals.</p>

<p>I didn’t become involved with open source software as a contributor until a few years ago, starting seriously with <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">RuboCop</a>. Once again, it was a practical thing. I liked using RuboCop and wanted it to get better. So I learned about open source and contributing by doing!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you code? If so, were you a coder when you got started with open source, and how did you learn to code?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I code. <a href="/about/">As I state on my About page</a>, I’ve been learning about computers and how to code since the late 1970s. It was a mixture of reading books and magazines, taking general classes, experimenting, and some college sprinkled in the middle there. To be honest, I’m always learning and improving my coding skills. But yes, I was already a coder when I got started with open source.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How have you participated in open source communities beyond code? Do you moderate forums, blog, tweet, give talks, push pixels, or support open source projects in some other way?</strong></p>

<p>As I stated above, I’m the Community Manager for Atom and Electron. This includes moderating <a href="https://discuss.atom.io">Discuss, the official Atom and Electron message board</a>, writing on the <a href="https://blog.atom.io">Atom blog</a>, tweeting from my <a href="https://twitter.com/leedohm">personal account</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/AtomEditor">Atom</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/electronjs">Electron</a> accounts. Along with all of that, I lead the effort to triage all incoming Atom Issues.</p>

<p>I’ve given exactly <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/leedohm/conversational-aikido-1">one talk</a> at this time.</p>

<p>I’m also a member of the Open Source virtual team within GitHub, working on improving open source on GitHub and in general.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How did you make the leap from casual bystander to participant? Did you have any mentors along the way? What were the challenges and barriers to entry?</strong></p>

<p>I dove in with both feet. I didn’t really have anyone that specifically took me under their wing, but people that were really encouraging to my early experiences with open source were: <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov">Bozhidar Batsov</a>, <a href="https://github.com/probablycorey">Corey Johnson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kevinsawicki">Kevin Sawicki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/benogle">Ben Ogle</a>.</p>

<p>The challenges were mostly around assuming my code wasn’t going to be good enough to share and thereby sweating wayyyyy too many details.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How satisfied are you with your career right now?</strong></p>

<p>More satisfied than I’ve ever been! I feel like I’m really making a difference in my career, the software industry and the world because of the things I’m doing at GitHub. I’m not just building yet another widget for people to buy, use and eventually end up in a trash heap somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What advice do you wish you could give your younger self?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Relax</li>
<li>Life is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game">zero-sum game</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://heartmindcode.com/2013/08/16/loyalty-and-layoffs/">Loyalty to a company is madness</a></li>
<li>Learn to scuba dive sooner … because it is the <strong>best</strong>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q: What gender and ethnicity/race do you identify as?</strong></p>

<p>I identify as a middle-aged white male.</p>

<hr>

<p>There you go. That’s my story. I hope it is interesting or enlightening to people <img alt="grinning" src="/images/emoji/grinning.png" class="emoji" /></p>

  </h4>

  <p>I’m a fan of so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard">“mechanical” keyboards</a>. They’re more expensive, but for someone who does as much typing as I do, I feel they are more comfortable and I know they are more durable in the long run. One thing that mechanical keyboards offer is the ultimate in customizability. Not only can you choose the feel of the keys when pressed, you can choose how much weight is required to activate them. And there are many companies offering many different ways to lay out the keys. One of these is the <a href="http://ergodox.org/">ErgoDox layout</a>.</p>

<p>ErgoDox is an “open-source” design. This means that anyone is free to take the idea and run with it. And that’s what <a href="https://input.club/">Input:Club</a> and <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/">MassDrop</a> did. They created a kit that you could use to build your own ErgoDox keyboard … with a modicum of soldering skills. I was intrigued, so I decided to give it a shot. I managed to get mine put together and it all seems to work!</p>

<p><a href="/images/ergodox.jpg" data-lightbox="My ErgoDox Keyboard" data-title="My ErgoDox Keyboard"><img src="/images/ergodox.jpg" alt="My ErgoDox Keyboard" width="100%"></a></p>

<p>The best part about the ErgoDox, and the other designs available at Input:Club, is that it is fully programmable. I can create my own custom layouts and organize the keyboard however I wish. It is also a “layered” system, so I can use special modifier keys in my custom layouts to shift between Dvorak and QWERTY, or use part of the keyboard as a numeric keypad, or whatever else I can come up with!</p>

<p>My latest firmware for my ErgoDox can be <a href="https://github.com/lee-dohm/kiibohd-controller">found on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>My specific choices for the keyboard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Switches:</strong> Gateron Blue</li>
<li>
<strong>Keycaps:</strong> <a href="http://keypuller.com/granite/">Granite</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>LEDs:</strong> No LEDs installed currently</li>
