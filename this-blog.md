# About This Blog

This blog is a combination of a traditional blog, where there are articles I've written myself, and a link blog where there is some minimal commentary about some link I found interesting. The external link symbol <span class="octicon octicon-link-external"></span> indicates when the title is a link to something out on the web that I found interesting or wanted to save. If there is no external link symbol, then the title links to the permanent page for the single post on this blog, also called a "permalink". In any case, the permalink symbol <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span> always links to the permanent page.
