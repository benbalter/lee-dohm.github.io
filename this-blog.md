# About This Blog

This blog is a combination of a traditional blog, where there are articles I've written myself, and a link blog where there is some minimal commentary about some link I found interesting. Any time you find the external link symbol <span class="octicon octicon-link-external"></span> at the end of the title of a post, the title points to something I wanted to save or wanted to share.
