[Git](https://git-scm.com/) has a really crappy user interface. It has commands with names that don't make sense. It has single commands that do, conceptually, multiple things. The thing to remember is that Git is a toolkit that you use to build your source control workflow. The problem is that since everyone has a slightly different workflow, everyone has to use the low-level tools.

This site helps people "see" what Git really does when commands are executed so that they can learn Git better and faster. I can't wait to really start using it to teach others Git.
