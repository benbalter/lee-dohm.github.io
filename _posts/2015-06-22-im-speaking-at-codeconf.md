I'm going to be speaking at [CodeConf 2015](http://codeconf.com/) in Nashville, Tennessee later this week! I'm excited to present a talk on the lessons I've learned in a year of being the moderator for [Discuss](https://discuss.atom.io), the official forum for the [Atom editor](https://atom.io) by [GitHub](https://github.com).

I've been a fan of [CodingHorror](http://blog.codinghorror.com/) *aka* [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/about-me/) for a number of years. Since he started [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/), I've been agreeing with him more and more on the state of online discussion groups, the state of the art in online discussion software, and overall how to encourage civil discourse in online communities. I have taken my role as moderator for Discuss very seriously. This is where I'm going to try and give a little back on specific techniques or notes to self I've had in this journey I've had with the Atom community. I hope they help others or at least are interesting and entertaining!
