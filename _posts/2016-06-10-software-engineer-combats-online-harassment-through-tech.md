I'm proud to work with [February Keeney](https://github.com/ihavenotea), as well as others on the Community and Safety team, at [GitHub](https://github.com). She and her team are doing great work that I'm excited to be a part of. I want tech to actually live up to its promise of being an unbiased place where everyone can thrive and flourish. Not because "everyone is the same online" but because everyone is different and *valued* for their differences. Give [her interview](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2016/06/10/february-keeney-github-tech-lgbt-pride-diversity.html) a watch! (Or at least read the transcript.)
