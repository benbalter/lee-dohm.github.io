[Silicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) is an element used in construction of semiconductors, most notoriously computer chips.  [Silicone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicone) is a type of plastic used for all manner of things, most notoriously breast implants.  Silicon is a component of silicone, but they are not synonymous.  Please stop using them as if they were.
