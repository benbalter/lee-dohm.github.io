   <title>Phishing Evolved</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a description of a very sophisticated phishing scam that almost caught a professional unawares. I have to admit, I might also have been caught up in this if I was in the author&amp;rsquo;s shoes. This is why two-factor authentication is so important. A username and password combination is just too easy to break these days.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Infinity 60% Keyboard</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2016/08/02/infinity-60-keyboard/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-02T19:19:15-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2016/08/02/infinity-60-keyboard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My latest keyboard experiment is by the same group that made the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/03/ergodox-keyboard/&quot;&gt;Infinity ErgoDox keyboard&lt;/a&gt; I talked about a while back. It is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://input.club/devices/infinity-keyboard&quot;&gt;Infinity 60% Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. There are three commonly-accepted sizes of keyboards for mechanical keyboard enthusiasts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full-size - the typical 104-key layout with the main keyboard, F-keys, full-sized arrow and navigation keys and a numeric keypad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deskthority.net/wiki/Tenkeyless_keyboard&quot;&gt;Tenkeyless&lt;/a&gt; - This is the same as the full size keyboard but the section containing the numeric keypad chopped off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://deskthority.net/wiki/60%25&quot;&gt;60%&lt;/a&gt; - a layout with just the main keyboard and nothing else, not even F-keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other less common layouts and there are even variations in categories, but these are the main ones. Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of my 60% keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/infinity-60-percent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Infinity 60% Keyboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What keyboard enthusiasts like about the smaller keyboards vary from person to person, but common reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve heard are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller keyboards take up less desk space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting rid of the extra keys is more efficient because it forces you to use more key combinations so your hands move less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s challenging and fun to learn new keyboard layouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smaller keyboards can be taken traveling more easily meaning that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/mortenteinum/27920424870&quot;&gt;one never has to type on an inferior keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested in the Infinity 60% for the challenge or even necessarily the small size. I liked the idea of it because it, like the ErgoDox, is fully programmable. I can completely rework the way the keyboard operates and even create special functions or macros. For example, when I hold down the Caps Lock key, the blue, green, orange, and red buttons in the upper right become media keys: Mute, Play/Pause, Volume Down, and Volume Up respectively. This way, I can make the keyboard work best for me &amp;hellip; not conform myself to the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, I may try out the keyboard on the road the next time I go traveling &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switches:&lt;/strong&gt; Cherry MX Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keycaps:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keypuller.com/pulse/&quot;&gt;Pulse SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEDs:&lt;/strong&gt; No LEDs installed currently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is provably untrue. One of the most commonly-used symmetric encryption algorithms, the Advanced Encryption Standard or AES, was originally known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard&quot;&gt;Rijndael&lt;/a&gt;. Why was it called that? Because it was invented by two Belgian cryptographers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi claimed in a hearing that, &amp;ldquo;In this smartphone, almost everything came from federal investments in research &amp;hellip; Federal research invented it.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big leap, going from funding research in individual components to claiming sole responsibility for inventing a specific configuration of technologies. I will concede that federally-funded research made &lt;em&gt;the smartphone&lt;/em&gt; possible, though not necessarily the iPhone. Just like I will freely state that federally-funded research made the modern Internet possible. But to utterly discount and devalue the blood, sweat and tears that hundreds and thousands of inventors, craftspeople, software developers, designers, factory workers and many, many others have contributed is pure, unabashed arrogance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know what makes federally-funded research possible? Taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How Open Source Has Impacted My Career</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2016/06/10/my-story-about-how-open-source-has-impacted-my-career/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-10T09:00:51-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2016/06/10/my-story-about-how-open-source-has-impacted-my-career</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another person I work with at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bkeepers&quot;&gt;Brandon Keepers&lt;/a&gt;, is working on a talk about the relationship between community participation and careers. He&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bkeepers/b3bffa5b5d66f61a58f66c7cfddbca0a&quot;&gt;asked a few questions&lt;/a&gt; of people who feel that open source has impacted their career. Since I feel I fall into that camp, I wanted to answer his questions and felt that others might be interested in my answers &amp;hellip; so here they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What impact has participation in open source had on your career?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my current job as the Community Manager of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/atom&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/electron/electron&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; projects at GitHub directly from my work with Atom&amp;rsquo;s community and contributing to the Atom project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How did you first get exposed to open source, and what attracted you to learning more about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly what first exposed me to open source. It was probably some piece of BBS-support software that I used to run my &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat!_BBS&quot;&gt;Wildcat! BBS&lt;/a&gt; in the very early 1990s. At the time, it was simply a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as learning more about it, in the late-1990s you couldn&amp;rsquo;t be a professional software developer without having some familiarity with what open source was. Since I was supporting a family of five on my single income, I felt at the time that traditional commercial software was more aligned with my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t become involved with open source software as a contributor until a few years ago, starting seriously with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, it was a practical thing. I liked using RuboCop and wanted it to get better. So I learned about open source and contributing by doing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Do you code? If so, were you a coder when you got started with open source, and how did you learn to code?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I code. &lt;a href=&quot;/about/&quot;&gt;As I state on my About page&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about computers and how to code since the late 1970s. It was a mixture of reading books and magazines, taking general classes, experimenting, and some college sprinkled in the middle there. To be honest, I&amp;rsquo;m always learning and improving my coding skills. But yes, I was already a coder when I got started with open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How have you participated in open source communities beyond code? Do you moderate forums, blog, tweet, give talks, push pixels, or support open source projects in some other way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated above, I&amp;rsquo;m the Community Manager for Atom and Electron. This includes moderating &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.atom.io&quot;&gt;Discuss, the official Atom and Electron message board&lt;/a&gt;, writing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom blog&lt;/a&gt;, tweeting from my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leedohm&quot;&gt;personal account&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AtomEditor&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/electronjs&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; accounts. Along with all of that, I lead the effort to triage all incoming Atom Issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve given exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/leedohm/conversational-aikido-1&quot;&gt;one talk&lt;/a&gt; at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also a member of the Open Source virtual team within GitHub, working on improving open source on GitHub and in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How did you make the leap from casual bystander to participant? Did you have any mentors along the way? What were the challenges and barriers to entry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dove in with both feet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have anyone that specifically took me under their wing, but people that were really encouraging to my early experiences with open source were: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov&quot;&gt;Bozhidar Batsov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/probablycorey&quot;&gt;Corey Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kevinsawicki&quot;&gt;Kevin Sawicki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benogle&quot;&gt;Ben Ogle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenges were mostly around assuming my code wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be good enough to share and thereby sweating wayyyyy too many details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: How satisfied are you with your career right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More satisfied than I&amp;rsquo;ve ever been! I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m really making a difference in my career, the software industry and the world because of the things I&amp;rsquo;m doing at GitHub. I&amp;rsquo;m not just building yet another widget for people to buy, use and eventually end up in a trash heap somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What advice do you wish you could give your younger self?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life is not a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game&quot;&gt;zero-sum game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://heartmindcode.com/2013/08/16/loyalty-and-layoffs/&quot;&gt;Loyalty to a company is madness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to scuba dive sooner &amp;hellip; because it is the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: What gender and ethnicity/race do you identify as?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I identify as a middle-aged white male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go. That&amp;rsquo;s my story. I hope it is interesting or enlightening to people :grinning:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>ErgoDox Keyboard</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2016/06/03/ergodox-keyboard/"/>
   <updated>2016-06-03T05:51:45-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2016/06/03/ergodox-keyboard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;mechanical&amp;rdquo; keyboards&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re more expensive, but for someone who does as much typing as I do, I feel they are more comfortable and I know they are more durable in the long run. One thing that mechanical keyboards offer is the ultimate in customizability. Not only can you choose the feel of the keys when pressed, you can choose how much weight is required to activate them. And there are many companies offering many different ways to lay out the keys. One of these is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ergodox.org/&quot;&gt;ErgoDox layout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ErgoDox is an &amp;ldquo;open-source&amp;rdquo; design. This means that anyone is free to take the idea and run with it. And that&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://input.club/&quot;&gt;Input:Club&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massdrop.com/&quot;&gt;MassDrop&lt;/a&gt; did. They created a kit that you could use to build your own ErgoDox keyboard &amp;hellip; with a modicum of soldering skills. I was intrigued, so I decided to give it a shot. I managed to get mine put together and it all seems to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ergodox.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My ErgoDox Keyboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about the ErgoDox, and the other designs available at Input:Club, is that it is fully programmable. I can create my own custom layouts and organize the keyboard however I wish. It is also a &amp;ldquo;layered&amp;rdquo; system, so I can use special modifier keys in my custom layouts to shift between Dvorak and QWERTY, or use part of the keyboard as a numeric keypad, or whatever else I can come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My latest firmware for my ErgoDox can be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/kiibohd-controller&quot;&gt;found on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My specific choices for the keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switches:&lt;/strong&gt; Gateron Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keycaps:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://keypuller.com/granite/&quot;&gt;Granite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEDs:&lt;/strong&gt; No LEDs installed currently&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; has a really crappy user interface. It has commands with names that don&amp;rsquo;t make sense. It has single commands that do, conceptually, multiple things. The thing to remember is that Git is a toolkit that you use to build your source control workflow. The problem is that since everyone has a slightly different workflow, everyone has to use the low-level tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site helps people &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; what Git really does when commands are executed so that they can learn Git better and faster. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to really start using it to teach others Git.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Common Testing Mistakes: Testing Code That Isn't Yours</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/10/16/common-testing-mistakes-testing-code-that-isnt-yours/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-16T22:42:31-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/10/16/common-testing-mistakes-testing-code-that-isnt-yours</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A phase that it seems all people learning to write tests for their code go through, myself included at one point, is &amp;ldquo;falling down the test rabbit hole&amp;rdquo;. During this phase the new tester believes that the only truly valid test is a test that validates that absolutely everything happens the way that it is expected. There are a couple problems with this approach, one is that you&amp;rsquo;re doing work with no reward and the other is that it can make your tests more brittle, in other words less resilient in the face of change. So the rabbit-hole tester creates tests that have no benefit and yet can have a significant cost in maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take for example that we have a typical web application that performs your standard CRUD&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; actions on database records of some sort. We need to test that when someone goes to the website, presses the &amp;ldquo;New Record&amp;rdquo; button, fills in the form and presses &amp;ldquo;Save&amp;rdquo; that the appropriate new record is created. The rabbit-hole tester might suggest that we need to test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the table in the database has a new record&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the new record in the database has the expected ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the new record in the database has the expected values in the expected columns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is testing code that isn&amp;rsquo;t yours because you&amp;rsquo;re no longer verifying that your code works, you&amp;rsquo;re verifying that the database works.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The problem with the three rabbit-hole tests above is that it tests things that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t actually care about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the implementation details change, our tests will break until they are updated for the new implementation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we properly test this? We test that the &lt;em&gt;application&lt;/em&gt; behaves the way we expect:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That we can query for the record and find it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That the record we find has the values we expect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is to perform your verifications at the same level of abstraction as the component that you&amp;rsquo;re testing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandimetz.com/&quot;&gt;Sandi Metz&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://speakerdeck.com/skmetz/magic-tricks-of-testing-railsconf&quot;&gt;great presentation about this&lt;/a&gt; that describes simple rules to know when you are testing at the correct level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one first starts testing, it seems like the right thing to do is to test everything. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t achieve the real goal of tests, to allow one to confidently change things and know that you aren&amp;rsquo;t breaking them. When you test everything, you make it so nothing can be changed without breaking some test. Testing only your code and not anyone else&amp;rsquo;s helps your tests ensure your code&amp;rsquo;s reliability and also its flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CRUD is an acronym for &amp;ldquo;Create, Read, Update, and Delete&amp;rdquo;, the standard set of database actions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that isn&amp;rsquo;t your job. Testing that the database works is the database developer&amp;rsquo;s job.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/08/29/bluetooth-mechanical-keyboard/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-29T00:18:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/08/29/bluetooth-mechanical-keyboard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of what is referred to as &amp;ldquo;mechanical keyboards&amp;rdquo;. They are keyboards with certain kinds of key switches that use levers and springs to give a specifically designed resistance curve to give more tactile and optionally auditory feedback to someone who is used to touch typing. I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased a fair number of them and have quite the selection to choose from in various forms. But the one thing that all of these mechanical keyboards have in common &amp;hellip; the cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them have a silly little six foot long USB cable permanently affixed to the back. They spruce them up in various ways. You can buy colored cables, special paracord woven cables. Some have detachable cables because what is probably going to wear out first between the cable and the electronics inside is the cable itself. Many have grooves and channels on the bottom to allow you to decide where you want your cable to pop out the back or the side of the keyboard to keep things nice and tidy. But what if I don&amp;rsquo;t want the damned cable anymore? The selection is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; slim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few available wireless mechanical keyboards is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massdrop.com/buy/varmilo-vb87m-bluetooth&quot;&gt;Varmilo VB87M Bluetooth LE keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, that I just picked up from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massdrop.com&quot;&gt;Massdrop&lt;/a&gt;. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with your computer or device, so you have to have a Bluetooth v4+ chipset to be able to use it. Fortunately, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/kb/SP707?locale=en_US&amp;amp;viewlocale=en_US&quot;&gt;Retina iMac&lt;/a&gt; does have such a chipset. And since the VB87M was billed as having &amp;ldquo;full Mac compatibility&amp;rdquo;, I sprung for it. I got it configured with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Top-printed legends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red LED backlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gateron Blue key switches (very similar to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/switch_guides#wiki_cherry_corp_mx&quot;&gt;Cherry MX Blue switches&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, the keyboard seems &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; compatible with OS X. It isn&amp;rsquo;t recognized automatically as a Bluetooth keyboard. But once I went to the Bluetooth preferences I was able to find the keyboard and pair it with my Mac. Once it was paired, it worked like any other Windows-style keyboard with media keys support. I did need to install &lt;a href=&quot;https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/&quot;&gt;Karabiner&lt;/a&gt; in order to smooth over a couple minor wrinkles, but this is nothing new for trying to use a Windows keyboard on a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Feel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://deskthority.net/wiki/Keycap_construction#PBT&quot;&gt;PBT plastic&lt;/a&gt; key caps simply feel more durable than most key caps. When struck, they have a solid feel. On the other hand, the top surface of the keys feels smoother than other PBT keys I&amp;rsquo;ve used. Also, the key caps are shorter than typical for the standard Cherry key profile. But since the key switches follow the Cherry-compatible standard, the key caps can be replaced with pretty much key set I choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth LE connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comes with a USB cable, but it is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for charging the internal battery which reportedly lasts for at least a week on a charge&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultra-durable PBT key caps with either top-printed or front-printed legends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice of color for the case (black or white)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice of color for the LED backlighting (white, red, blue or none)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choice of key switches from two manufacturers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much time with the keyboard yet, but so far it is the best keyboard for the Mac that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with other than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wasdkeyboards.com&quot;&gt;WASD Keyboards&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daskeyboard.com/&quot;&gt;Das Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; models. And unlike those others, it is wireless!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pictured: Black case, front-printed key cap legends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/varmilo-vb87m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Varmilo VB87M Keyboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even normal Bluetooth connectivity doesn&amp;rsquo;t require much power. I would be surprised if the internal battery lasts for less than a month on a single charge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Why Download Count is a Crappy Metric</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/08/17/why-download-count-is-a-crappy-metric/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-17T13:22:12-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/08/17/why-download-count-is-a-crappy-metric</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I see people trying to make all kinds of false inferences based on download counts&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of things. Which of the following statements are true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that has been downloaded more means it is more popular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that has been downloaded more means it has more current active users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that has been downloaded more means it is of higher quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that has been downloaded more means it is of lower quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you guessed that none of them are true, you would be correct. Here are just a few of the many possible counter-examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X has been available twice as long as Y, even though they are equally popular&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X has a much higher abandon rate than Y, meaning people try X and stop using it but people who use Y stay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X has had many updates for bug fixes whereas Y was written right the first time and hasn&amp;rsquo;t needed many fixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X has added features in every update whereas Y has been fixing bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above examples, X is the thing that is downloaded more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we infer from one thing having a higher download count than another? We can only state for certain that &lt;em&gt;it has been downloaded more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The reason for this is that all a download count tells you is that the item was downloaded, it can&amp;rsquo;t tell you &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it was downloaded. All of the above fallacies make assumptions as to why people are downloading something without considering all of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; reasons it could be downloaded. This makes it completely meaningless as a metric of comparison between two things because the reasons for downloading X and Y could be vastly different. And it is nearly useless even when comparing the same thing between two points in time when the time window is large because reasons for downloading can shift over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If download count is such a crappy metric, then why does pretty much every package/plugin/add-on manager provide a download count for things? In my opinion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it is easy to track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because it gives the person who built the package/plugin/add-on a warm fuzzy to see their download count go up over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because people insist on ascribing meaning to it, so they demand it even though it isn&amp;rsquo;t useful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, download counts aren&amp;rsquo;t going away. Let&amp;rsquo;s just not have any illusions about what they really mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the same goes for install/upgrade counts as well, even if you keep track of them separately.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of you will remember back when virtually every web page had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_counter&quot;&gt;hit counter&lt;/a&gt;. The reason why you don&amp;rsquo;t see them anymore is because hit counters, like download counters, are virtually meaningless as a metric of comparison except to that hit counter on that exact page. This is why we now have metrics like number of sessions, average session length, users and pages per session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also have the metric of &amp;ldquo;impressions&amp;rdquo; which most people think is the same as &amp;ldquo;hits&amp;rdquo; but it isn&amp;rsquo;t. An impression is a single load of a specific page by a single user. Hits were never very well defined and could include things like loading stylesheets or images as well as loading pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More rigorous, well-defined data is better :grinning:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>GitHub's New Code of Conduct and the Inevitable Backlash</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/08/03/githubs-new-code-of-conduct-and-the-inevitable-backlash/"/>
   <updated>2015-08-03T23:18:23-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/08/03/githubs-new-code-of-conduct-and-the-inevitable-backlash</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; announced that it was adopting &lt;a href=&quot;http://todogroup.org/&quot;&gt;the TODO Group&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.atom.io/2015/07/20/code-of-conduct.html&quot;&gt;Open Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; for its open source projects, most specifically the Atom editor. It took a while for the segment of the tech community that feels threatened by attempts to be more inclusive to find out about it and for the backlash to begin. But it has now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are reacting strongly. Of course, everything they&amp;rsquo;re reacting to is taken completely out of context. The main part they&amp;rsquo;re reacting to is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;safety&lt;/strong&gt; over privileged people&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;comfort&lt;/strong&gt;. We will not act on complaints regarding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Reverse&amp;rdquo; -isms, including &amp;ldquo;reverse racism,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;reverse sexism,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cisphobia&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Emphasis mine.) They are saying that this clause invalidates the entire rest of the document, that the code of conduct is somehow now racist and sexist. Of course, if this clause were taken out, they&amp;rsquo;d find some other part to nitpick. And again and again &amp;hellip; until there is nothing left. They won&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied with anything less than the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/06/27/slides-from-my-talk-at-codeconf.html&quot;&gt;my recent talk&lt;/a&gt;, I made the radical point that people have &lt;em&gt;the right to expect to feel safe&lt;/em&gt; in our online communities. That people have the right to not be harassed. That people have the right to be free from online bullies. They even have the right to expect not to have to put up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-guidelines/issues/75#issuecomment-124737886&quot;&gt;subtle digs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; designed to demean, degrade or exclude. And I made the explicit point that people who expect to be &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; from these rules restricting them from, intentionally or unintentionally, being jerks to people are people that &lt;em&gt;we don&amp;rsquo;t need in our communities.&lt;/em&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t care how good of a programmer you are or what great ideas you have or how long you&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to the Open Source community. If you treat people like shit, I expect you to be shown the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a civilized society, we have rules. These aren&amp;rsquo;t just &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t kill each other.&amp;rdquo; They extend to things like &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t play your music loud after 9pm.&amp;rdquo; And occasionally, people have parties and play their music loud after 9pm. Sometimes their neighbors aren&amp;rsquo;t bothered. Sometimes they go around and ask their neighbors first if it will be OK. But only an asshole whines about their &amp;ldquo;rights&amp;rdquo; when the cops come to their door to tell them to turn the music down or cries &amp;ldquo;poor baby&amp;rdquo; when people try to pass ordinances to make things more comfortable for &lt;em&gt;everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really hilarious about this particular example is that the person who decided to bring gender into it is arguing for the same outcome as the woman they&amp;rsquo;re pushing aside. But she&amp;rsquo;s just a woman, so why should he bother to read what she has to say before putting &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; two cents in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Huge Android Vulnerability Found</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/29/huge-android-vulnerability-found/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-29T22:13:32-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/29/huge-android-vulnerability-found</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/28/stagefright-android-vulnerability-heartbleed-mobile&quot;&gt;A vulnerability has been found in Android&lt;/a&gt; that has the potential to be very damaging. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any interaction from the owner of the device and allows an attacker to access the device and all of its data remotely. According to the security researcher who found the bug, it can take over the phone &amp;ldquo;before the sound that you&amp;rsquo;ve received a message has even occurred &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes this even more damaging is that despite the fact that Google claims that in newer versions of the Android operating system users are protected from the worst of the bug, people who &lt;em&gt;aren&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; running newer versions may have to buy a completely new phone to get a fix. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much influence over the actual devices that run Android as Apple does over the devices that run iOS, Apple&amp;rsquo;s mobile operating system. For the most part, the devices in people&amp;rsquo;s hands can only be updated by the mobile carriers or the device manufacturers, two groups that have historically been very reluctant to update old devices to newer versions of Android, even in the face of security fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the distribution of versions of Android that people are actually using today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/android-versions-july-2015.png&quot; alt=&quot;Android version distribution&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See that part of the pie marked &amp;ldquo;Lollipop&amp;rdquo;? That&amp;rsquo;s most likely what Google means when it says &amp;ldquo;newer versions&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So the vast majority (approximately 88%) of Android devices people are actually using are completely vulnerable to this. And according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp&quot;&gt;most recent IDC smartphone market share data&lt;/a&gt;, Android has an estimated 78% of the smartphone market as measured by shipments.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This means as much as two-thirds of the smartphones currently in use are completely vulnerable to this attack :see_no_evil: With possibly no relief other than &amp;ldquo;buy a new phone&amp;rdquo; :scream:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has the potential to &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; impact the mobile market. It will be interesting to see how everyone handles it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;table table-striped&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Version&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Codename&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Distribution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Froyo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.3%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2.3.3-2.3.7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gingerbread&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.0.3-4.0.4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ice Cream Sandwich&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.1%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.1.x&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Jelly Bean&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14.7%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.2.x&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17.5%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4.4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;KitKat&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;39.2%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Lollipop&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;11.6%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5.1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0.8%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html&quot;&gt;Source: Google Dashboards&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are potentially huge flaws with measuring &amp;ldquo;market share&amp;rdquo; this way, but let&amp;rsquo;s leave that aside for now &amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What If the Second Amendment Applied to Autonomous Combat Drones?</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/27/what-if-the-second-amendment-applied-to-autonomous-combat-drones/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-27T23:52:02-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/27/what-if-the-second-amendment-applied-to-autonomous-combat-drones</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/625843527608459266&quot;&gt;this tweet from Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; earlier tonight. It is in reference to an open letter by AI and robotics researchers stating that there should be a ban on artificial intelligence research for the purpose of creating offensive autonomous weapons. And the open letter got me to thinking &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen what damage has been done by one person who has enough resources to afford a few hundred dollars worth of hand gun. Much of the time, they have more than just the one.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/2012/12/why-spree-killers-kill-themselves/&quot;&gt;according to some research&lt;/a&gt;, about half of the &amp;ldquo;spree killers&amp;rdquo; that caused more than two casualties, killed innocent victims and then took their own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if an autonomous combat drone was available to such a person for perhaps the same price as two hand guns? Think of what damage could be done by someone who, rather than using a semi-automatic pistol, took an autonomous combat drone to a school, or a park, or a mall. And then, even worse than that &amp;hellip; they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even have to take this drone there by themselves. It could pilot itself. It could select targets on its own, perhaps even targeting them by race, age or gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would the killer be guilt-ridden enough to kill themselves if they weren&amp;rsquo;t even present to watch their victims die?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A science fiction short story that had great impact on me as a young man made the point that humans have innate instincts that stop us from causing enough damage to someone to kill them &amp;hellip; at least until we invented weapons. Until we created weapons, like firearms, that allowed us to kill someone in an instant. Allowed us to kill someone before our instincts even had a chance to kick in. Weapons like cannons and howitzers and bombers that allowed us to kill someone before we could even &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might say that these technologies would only be possessed by the military. But can we trust the military with such weapons? Can we trust the military to keep these technologies from falling into &amp;ldquo;the wrong hands&amp;rdquo;?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We&amp;rsquo;ve seen how well that idea has protected the world from nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Answer: not very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As was popularized in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;a favorite movie of my youth&lt;/a&gt;, when the world was doing its best to fathom the &lt;strong&gt;gigantic&lt;/strong&gt; hole it had dug for itself with the invention of the nuclear bomb, &amp;ldquo;the only winning move is not to play&amp;rdquo;. The only real solution is to do our utmost to ensure that this technology &lt;em&gt;does not get invented&lt;/em&gt;. That is why I, as a professional software developer, have signed on to this letter to call for a worldwide ban on the creation of offensive autonomous weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need more efficient, less guilt-ridden, easier and cheaper ways to kill people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2610545/&quot;&gt;A poll in 2004&lt;/a&gt; found that 26% of individuals in the United States stated they owned at least one firearm. Almost half (48%) of those individuals reported owning &lt;em&gt;more than three&lt;/em&gt; firearms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory about why &amp;ldquo;spree killers&amp;rdquo; take their own lives is to deny society its punishment of them. If they do not feel they will be caught, would they perhaps not kill themselves and then be able to kill again?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about technologies falling into &amp;ldquo;the wrong hands&amp;rdquo; of course presupposes that the military having them is &amp;ldquo;the right hands&amp;rdquo;, which is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a given in my book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MPAA Emails Reveal Plan with Media and Mississippi Attorney General to Attack Google</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/26/mpaa-emails-reveal-plan-with-media-and-mississippi-attorney-general-to-attack-google/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-26T11:23:17-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/26/mpaa-emails-reveal-plan-with-media-and-mississippi-attorney-general-to-attack-google</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in a filing on Thursday, Google revealed one of the few emails that they have been able to get access to so far, and it&amp;rsquo;s stunning. It&amp;rsquo;s an email between the MPAA and two of [the Mississippi Attorney General&amp;rsquo;s] top lawyers &amp;hellip; discussing the big plan to &amp;ldquo;hurt&amp;rdquo; Google. Beyond influencing other Attorneys General (using misleading fake &amp;ldquo;setups&amp;rdquo; of searches for &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; material) and paying for fake anti-Google research, the lawyers from Hood&amp;rsquo;s office flat out admit that they&amp;rsquo;re expecting the MPAA and the major studios to have its media arms run a coordinated propaganda campaign of bogus anti-Google stories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was said during the financial crisis that the banks were &amp;ldquo;too big to fail&amp;rdquo;, I thought the solution was simple. I thought that we should put laws in place that banks aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to get anywhere near that big again. That the country&amp;rsquo;s wealth should not be allowed to accumulate in so few hands. It&amp;rsquo;s so obvious that people say it all the time, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t put all your eggs in one basket.&amp;rdquo; Isn&amp;rsquo;t that what financiers are telling people all the time? Diversify!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I am beginning to believe that the same is true of any kind of power, where financial power is just one kind. The accumulation of great power in few hands is something that the framers of the Constitution of the United States were understandably wary about. That&amp;rsquo;s why they separated the powers between the branches of government. That&amp;rsquo;s why they created a bicameral system for Congress. But whereas in their time, the great powers were governmental, in our time the great powers are corporate. And we can&amp;rsquo;t trust the free market to keep power from accumulating &amp;hellip; because the whole purpose of business is to consolidate wealth &amp;hellip; and therefore power.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gamers Ruining Gaming? Half-Life 3 May Never Be Released</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/25/gamers-ruining-gaming/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-25T14:33:41-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/25/gamers-ruining-gaming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to this new rumor, the long-awaited next installment in the hugely popular &lt;a href=&quot;http://valvesoftware.com/games/hl2.html&quot;&gt;Half-Life series&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://valvesoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;may never be released&lt;/em&gt;. The two reasons are, essentially:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valve makes just as much money from their other properties as they would from releasing Half-Life 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Half-Life 3 is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;even perceived to be less than perfect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, there &lt;em&gt;could be&lt;/em&gt; a huge backlash from their &amp;ldquo;fans&amp;rdquo; up to and including threats and/or physical attacks and other terror tactics (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing&quot;&gt;doxxing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting&quot;&gt;SWATting&lt;/a&gt;, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find #1 to be very plausible but #2 is the most interesting. Essentially, a subsection of gamer culture has become &lt;em&gt;so toxic&lt;/em&gt; that one of the largest and most talented game developers is, if the rumor is true, deciding to possibly &lt;em&gt;no longer make games&lt;/em&gt; and simply relegate themselves to serving as a platform for others to sell their games upon. Because it is safer. Because some gamers act like terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what? If the rumor is true &amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Does the Secretary of Homeland Security Have to Hide?</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/22/what-does-the-secretary-of-homeland-security-have-to-hide/"/>

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/22/what-does-the-secretary-of-homeland-security-have-to-hide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I suppose it is remotely conceivable that in seeking a waiver, 20 or more government officials could all be wishing to talk to each other through a Web-based e-mail service about such matters as baseball games or retirement luncheons they might be attending,&amp;rdquo; [Jason R. Baron, a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration] said. &amp;ldquo;But it is simply not reasonable to assume that in seeking a waiver that the officials involved were only contemplating using a commercial network for personal (that is, non-official) communications.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks banging the security drum often say, &amp;ldquo;You shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need privacy if you don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to hide.&amp;rdquo; Well, if that is true, what is the Secretary of Homeland Security and 28 of his senior staff hiding? And if it is just baseball games and retirement luncheons, then why can&amp;rsquo;t they wait until they get home or go on lunch to conduct that business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to work for Raytheon, a major United States defense contractor. There were some defense projects that you weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to conduct personal business &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; while you were at the job site whether it was email, phone calls, or any other method of transmission. Besides just being bad form taking up the contract&amp;rsquo;s time with personal business, it was literally a matter of national security. When you have &amp;ldquo;Homeland Security&amp;rdquo; in your title, I would think that you would have more respect for these things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Apple has pretty much nailed the design of the watch. The controls are well-executed and placed in a pragmatic position, in a way that I haven’t really seen anyone else achieve yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Numeric Breakdown of Why Wholesale Surveillance Doesn't Work</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/10/numeric-breakdown-of-why-wholesale-surveillance-doesnt-work/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-10T18:20:39-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/07/10/numeric-breakdown-of-why-wholesale-surveillance-doesnt-work</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reddit user &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/0v3rk1ll&quot;&gt;/u/0v3rk1ll&lt;/a&gt; gave &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3csl2y/wikileaks_releases_over_a_million_emails_from/csyjuw6&quot;&gt;a detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; of exactly why invading the privacy of an entire country simply does not yield useful results. It boils down to the fact that for every system that is used to examine an item and then make a determination whether that item falls into Group A (in this case Terrorists) or Group B (not Terrorists) has two important qualities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A success rate &amp;mdash; the percentage of actual members of Group A will be identified as Group A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A false positive rate &amp;mdash; the percentage of actual members of Group B that will be identified incorrectly as Group A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when the success rate is unrealistically high and the false positive rate is unrealistically low, if the numbers of members of Group A are significantly smaller than Group B, you will get &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; more false positives than successes. The numbers that 0v3rk1ll gave for a simple example were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Population of 300 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 million of the population are Group A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success Rate = 99%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False Positive Rate = 1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that \(1million \times 99\% \simeq ~1million\). But \(300million \times 1\% = 3million\)! This means that even in this unrealistic example the system will be returning &lt;em&gt;three times as many bad results as good ones&lt;/em&gt;. And it only gets worse the more realistic you make the numbers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Population of 300 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 million of the population are Group A&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Success Rate = 50% \(\Rightarrow 1million \times 50\% = 0.5million\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;False Positive Rate = 20% \(\Rightarrow 300million \times 20\% = 60million\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means &lt;strong&gt;bad results outnumber good by nearly 120 times&lt;/strong&gt; and that now you have to investigate 60.5 million people. And 60 million of them are completely innocent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a horrific invasion of privacy for &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; real benefit again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only 400,000 entries on the FBI&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_Screening_Database&quot;&gt;Terrorist Watch List&lt;/a&gt;, so even 1 million is unrealistically high. The futility of wholesale surveillance is only more apparent the more realistic the scenarios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The FBI Doesn't Want to Have to Force Tech Companies to Weaken Encryption</title>

&lt;p&gt;It’s never a good sign when you have to declare during a debate that &amp;ldquo;I really am not a maniac.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FBI continues to peddle its stance that the only way to prevent crime and terrorism is for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; citizens to give up protecting their data from those who would take it from them, legally or illegally. This time the government is saying that we don&amp;rsquo;t have to trust &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; with the keys to our respective kingdoms, just let the corporations have them. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that there will never be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-warns-of-rise-in-disgruntled-employees-stealing-data-1411516389&quot;&gt;disgruntled employee that will steal customer data from the company&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that an employee of some company will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be careless with data, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secpoint.com/theft-of-laptop-sends-people-to-panic.html&quot;&gt;allowing it to get stolen along with a company laptop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You know who is not going to protect my data as tenaciously as I will? Literally anyone &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than me. The more people that have access to my data, the more likely it will be compromised. It is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; simple. I don&amp;rsquo;t care if that other party is the government, a corporation or the lady down the street (though I&amp;rsquo;m sure she&amp;rsquo;s a really nice person).&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m excited to present a talk on the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in a year of being the moderator for &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.atom.io&quot;&gt;Discuss&lt;/a&gt;, the official forum for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom editor&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Since he started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discourse.org/&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been agreeing with him more and more on the state of online discussion groups, the state of the art in online discussion software, and overall how to encourage civil discourse in online communities. Because of this, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken my role as moderator for Discuss very seriously, doing my best to create an online community where civil and helpful discussions are the rule &amp;hellip; not the exception. With this talk, I&amp;rsquo;m elaborating on specific techniques found or self-discoveries made in my journey with the Atom community. I hope they help others or at least are interesting and entertaining!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The War for the Soul of Geek Culture</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best summary I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard that applies to the uproar in geek culture as a whole came from one of my coworkers. He asked me what Gamergate was all about, and after I explained, he paused for a moment, digesting what I&amp;rsquo;d said. Then: &amp;ldquo;So&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s like a restaurant that always serves chicken decides to add some salad to its menu and people freak out because they think the chicken will go away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip;yes. Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is the first article about GamerGate that made me sad about all the horrible things that GamerGate stands for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; makes me hopeful for the future. It even makes me a little sad that I&amp;rsquo;m not younger that I won&amp;rsquo;t get to enjoy the truly inclusive geek culture that will hopefully come out of all of this upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The sharks were given two main objectives,&amp;rdquo; Perry&amp;rsquo;s choreographer RJ Durell tells THR. &amp;ldquo;One, perform Katy&amp;rsquo;s trademark moves to the &amp;lsquo;Teenage Dream&amp;rsquo; chorus, which they both did perfectly; and two, to have loads of fun, and bring to life these characters in a cartoon manner, giving them a Tweedledee/Tweedledum-type persona.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think it&amp;rsquo;s awesome that it was intentional. The cynical and jaded part of me is suggesting that it is all retconning, but I&amp;rsquo;m telling that part of me to shut up. Go Left Shark go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, because where the information comes from is more important than the facts themselves &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people seem to think the measles is a nuisance disease — irritating and briefly unpleasant, but otherwise harmless. For many, it’s not so bad. For others, the measles is serious and potentially fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sad that people have to be convinced of this.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>More Detail About the Man Threatening to "Confront" Brianna Wu</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even supporters of Gamergate, uneasy with his threats of violence, contacted me with personal testimony about experiences with him, which I also forwarded [to law enforcement] &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;Brianna Wu in an email to Jezebel.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt;! If even Gamergate&amp;rsquo;s supporters are saying this guy scares them &amp;hellip; why haven&amp;rsquo;t the police arrested this man yet? What is law enforcement for but to serve and &lt;strong&gt;protect&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got so many more thoughts about this transformation of our nation&amp;rsquo;s law enforcement organizations from &amp;ldquo;citizens on patrol&amp;rdquo; into soldiers fighting a hypothetical &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo;. And I think that shift in mindset has negatively impacted functions such as these &amp;hellip; the very functions that our police, sheriffs, troopers and marshalls were originally intended to perform. But I am literally &lt;em&gt;seething&lt;/em&gt; with anger right now &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to write it up later when I have a clearer head.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Using Project-Specific Gems Without Bundle Exec</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/29/using-project-specific-gems-without-bundle-exec/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-29T08:34:14-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/29/using-project-specific-gems-without-bundle-exec</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you use Ruby a lot like I do, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably gone through at least a few steps of this cycle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby is awesome! :metal:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, I just need to figure out how to make it do more :cry:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RubyGems are awesome! :metal: They help me make Ruby do more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But managing them is a pain :cry:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bundler.io/&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; is awesome! :metal: It manages the Gems and their dependencies!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But I just need to figure out how to always use the right version when I&amp;rsquo;m working on a specific project that uses different versions than everything else :cry:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle exec&lt;/code&gt; is awesome! :metal: It loads the right versions of everything for the current project!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it is a lot of typing for every command :cry:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases are awesome! :metal: Now I only have to type &lt;code&gt;be rake&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;bundle exec rake&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bundler.io/v1.7/bundle_binstubs.html&quot;&gt;Bundler binstubs&lt;/a&gt; are awesome! :metal: Now I only have to type &lt;code&gt;bin/rake&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;be rake&lt;/code&gt; &amp;hellip; :confused:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huh &amp;hellip; that isn&amp;rsquo;t any better, as a matter of fact, that&amp;rsquo;s more typing. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; I have to remember to do the extra step of generating the binstubs for every project. Why bother in that case?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s where things stopped for me for a long time &amp;hellip; Until now! :metal: Ok, maybe I&amp;rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I figured out recently &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly refining my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/dotfiles&quot;&gt;dotfiles project&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles&quot;&gt;Thoughtbot&amp;rsquo;s dotfiles&lt;/a&gt; as a basis. There is a lot to grok in that collection of useful tools and settings and I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking my time figuring it out. One thing that I noticed, but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of was this little bit of code in the shell profile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# mkdir .git/safe in the root of repositories you trust&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;.git/safe/../../bin:$PATH&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, until recently when I put two and two together. I remembered that I could use Bundler&amp;rsquo;s binstubs, which, combined with this trick would allow me to type simply &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;bin/rake&lt;/code&gt; or even &lt;code&gt;be rake&lt;/code&gt;. Assuming you already have a project that uses Ruby, RubyGems and Bundler, here&amp;rsquo;s how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the above &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; modification to your shell profile. Ensure that you execute it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; utilities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv&quot;&gt;rbenv&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://rvm.io&quot;&gt;rvm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From within your project directory:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute &lt;code&gt;bundle binstub GEM&lt;/code&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;bundle binstub rake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute &lt;code&gt;mkdir .git/safe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you execute &lt;code&gt;which rake&lt;/code&gt; you should see that it points to the newly-generated binstub instead of the globally-installed one. Party on dudes! :metal:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Police Ask Waze to Remove Cop Tracking Feature</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/28/police-ask-waze-to-remove-cop-tracking-feature/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-28T06:30:49-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/28/police-ask-waze-to-remove-cop-tracking-feature</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, law enforcement officials have been urging the app and its owner, Google, to disable a feature that allows users to report when they&amp;rsquo;ve spotted a police officer, in real time, for all other Waze users to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really? &lt;strong&gt;So&lt;/strong&gt; hypocritical! When the FBI is screaming &amp;ldquo;think of the &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to drum up popular support for forcing Google and Apple to remove the privacy protections they put in place recently. When the government is spying on journalists by calling them terrorists. I guess the watchers don&amp;rsquo;t like being watched back. What&amp;rsquo;s the matter? You&amp;rsquo;ve been telling the citizens all along that if we don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to hide then we&amp;rsquo;ll be fine. Got something to hide?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I think the government systematically monitoring and spying on its citizens is &lt;em&gt;reprehensible&lt;/em&gt;. And I believe that the rhetoric used to justify that spying is deplorable. But I also strongly feel that peace officers must be held to a &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; standard than the common citizen, not a lower one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2014 Metacritic Game Publisher Rankings</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Theoretically they&amp;rsquo;re the 2015 rankings in that they are published in 2015, but they&amp;rsquo;re only for games released in 2014 &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting that only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the major publishers had an average Metacritic rating of &amp;ldquo;Good&amp;rdquo;, i.e. 75.0 or better. Given that I&amp;rsquo;ll only look at a game that has below an 80.0 if I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;desperate&lt;/em&gt;, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a great sign for the quality of games from 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>All Programming is Meta-Programming</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/27/all-programming-is-meta-programming/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-27T00:02:26-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/27/all-programming-is-meta-programming</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At my day job, I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a project that I&amp;rsquo;m building in Ruby. I&amp;rsquo;m building it in Ruby because I feel that it is the best tool for the job. Unfortunately, my coworkers don&amp;rsquo;t have the same wealth of experience with Ruby that I do, so a few of them are showing signs of trepidation. They&amp;rsquo;re worried about Ruby&amp;rsquo;s syntax quirks (essentially, that it isn&amp;rsquo;t a C-style language). They&amp;rsquo;ve got concerns about all of the &amp;ldquo;unnecessary syntactic sugar&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;crazy magic&amp;rdquo; that Ruby has. But when we write code, we&amp;rsquo;re always working with abstractions and layering them one on top of the other until we can do our job with a single statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t believe me? Well let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at some very simple code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;test-file.txt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;w&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Some test text&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this code do? Well, at the most basic level it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opens the file &lt;code&gt;test-file.txt&lt;/code&gt; for writing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writes the text &lt;code&gt;Some test text&lt;/code&gt; into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closes the file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even that is an abstraction. Opening the file abstracts away the OS-level file descriptor that is the handle to the file. Writing the text elides the fact that there is a buffer behind it that gets flushed to disk when you close the file. And sure, you might have known about all of that. But do you know the intimate details of all of the other layers of abstraction like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The OS-level system calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hardware driver for the bus type (IDE whether PATA or SATA, SCSI, USB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hardware driver for the specific drive type (HD, SSD, flash drive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The caching on the drive controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The caching on the drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laying down of the bits on the drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And &lt;em&gt;et cetera&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the writing of the text into the file. That leaves out all the stuff about managing file descriptors, the file system, the memory management and garbage collection of the &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; object and so, so many other things that we just take for granted when we write code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the way the human brain works, by building abstractions that allow us to understand more complex ideas by building up from simpler ones. Some of the most well-known research that shows this is in analyzing &lt;a href=&quot;http://theinvisiblegorilla.com/blog/2012/02/15/how-experts-recall-chess-positions/&quot;&gt;how the thought process of chess masters differs from novices&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, Chase and Simon replicated de Groot’s finding with another expert (a master-level player) as well as an amateur and a novice.  They also added a critical control: The players viewed both real chess positions and scrambled chess positions (that included pieces in implausible and even impossible locations). The expert excelled with the real positions, but performed no better than the amateur and novice for the scrambled positions &amp;hellip; The expert advantage apparently comes from familiarity with real chess positions, something that allows more efficient encoding or retrieval of the positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the research shows that programmers use the same memory patterns to recognize common code constructs from uncommon ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So everything in programming is an abstraction. And not only that, but an abstraction on top of an abstraction on top of an abstraction. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down#History&quot;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s turtles all the way down &amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt; but what does this have to do with Ruby?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has some syntactic features that allow you to create new abstractions that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like language constructs. Take, for example, the three lines of Ruby code near the beginning of this article. If we rewrote it in Java it might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;BufferedWriter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;BufferedWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;FileWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;test-file.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Some test text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This code does exactly the same thing as the Ruby code. But it does it at a lower level of abstraction. This Java code makes it clear that whether or not an error occurs, we&amp;rsquo;re going to close the file. But this is a really, really, really common code pattern. So common that C# created an official language construct just for ensuring that things get cleaned up called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fs2xkftw(VS.80).aspx&quot;&gt;Dispose Pattern&lt;/a&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StreamWriter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;StreamWriter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;test-file.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Some test text&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, that looks a lot like the Ruby code.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The difference is that &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; is a special keyword in C# that is baked into the language. Could you duplicate the Dispose Pattern without needing a special keyword? Sure, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as simple to write syntactically as &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt;, which is itself slightly more complicated than Ruby&amp;rsquo;s syntax above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about the Ruby &lt;code&gt;File.open&lt;/code&gt; syntax is that the part between the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; keywords is called a &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Every function in Ruby can accept one and only one block. So you&amp;rsquo;ll find this kind of pattern everywhere in Ruby:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;File.open&lt;/code&gt; passes the &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; object to the block and closes the file when the block exits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dir.chdir&lt;/code&gt; passes the path of the directory changed to into the block and changes back to the original directory when the block exits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Array.sort&lt;/code&gt; allows you to create a comparator function in place by passing a block describing the comparator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;String.gsub&lt;/code&gt; allows you to customize exactly how matched text is replaced by specifying a replacement function as a block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is just one of the ways that Ruby&amp;rsquo;s meta-programming features makes writing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reading code simpler. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing magic here. There&amp;rsquo;s just a new syntax for writing the same code.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Could you do the same stuff in other languages? Absolutely! Here&amp;rsquo;s how to sort a list of strings using a custom comparator in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sort_using_a_custom_comparator&quot;&gt;pretty much every language ever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me be perfectly clear. What makes Ruby special is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what it makes possible, because it is possible to do anything Ruby can do in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; Turing-complete language. What is special about Ruby is &lt;strong&gt;how much&lt;/strong&gt; it makes things simpler. And any tool that can make writing the next several layers of abstraction faster, simpler, more testable and readable? That&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I&amp;rsquo;m going to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am aware that Java now has the &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; syntax that is almost identical to C#&amp;rsquo;s Dispose Pattern. I&amp;rsquo;m not picking on Java, it was just an easy code pattern for me to remember.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are obvious parallels between Ruby blocks and JavaScript callback functions or Objective-C blocks, but neither of them are as simple to write or read as the Ruby version.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is most definitely syntactic sugar. And if you object to syntactic sugar, then I have to ask you why you aren&amp;rsquo;t writing in Assembler? And none of that mamby-pamby Macro Assembler either &amp;hellip; but down and dirty, nothing but the actual opcodes for your processor, have to declare your own &lt;code&gt;DATA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CODE&lt;/code&gt; segments Assembler. And then I&amp;rsquo;ll ask you if your name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/story-of-mel.html&quot;&gt;Mel Kaye&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, where education laws require &amp;ldquo;stressing&amp;rdquo; abstinence, teachers are prohibited from &amp;ldquo;any demonstration of how condoms or other contraceptives are applied.&amp;rdquo; Nonetheless, 76 percent of Mississippi teenagers report having sex before the end of high school, and a third of babies in the state are born to teenage mothers. One teacher came up with a creative solution for imparting some wisdom to students about condoms &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man looks like a great teacher. His energy reminds me of some of the best I had while growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the infected were unvaccinated against the disease, including kids who were too young for the shots and anti-vaxxers who chose against them. That&amp;rsquo;s how you get an outbreak. But six of the cases got their measles-mumps-rubella vaccine&amp;mdash;the MMR shot&amp;mdash;and still managed to get infected. And all but two of them had gotten at least two doses, the standard recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pitchfork published a new interview with Björk on Wednesday, and in it she speaks powerfully about the kind of sexism she&amp;rsquo;s faced in her career. Asked by Jessica Hopper about early reports that Arca was the &amp;ldquo;sole producer&amp;rdquo; on the album rather than, as Arca later clarified, a co-producer &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t just a problem in tech. And I don&amp;rsquo;t want to belittle the experience of women in tech because it is horrible. I want to show that this issue is pervasive in our society. This is a &lt;em&gt;big problem&lt;/em&gt; that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be thought of as an issue that only those socially inept tech nerds have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the smartest teams were distinguished by three characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, their members contributed more equally to the team’s discussions&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, their members scored higher on a test &amp;hellip; which measures how well people can read complex emotional states&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, teams with more women outperformed teams with more men &amp;hellip; it was not &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; (having equal numbers of men and women) that mattered &amp;hellip; but simply having more women &amp;hellip; explained by the fact that women, on average, were better at &amp;ldquo;mindreading&amp;rdquo; than men.&lt;/p&gt;

The response so far seems to have been to double down and make it, if anything, worse: cubicles are now decidedly un-cool so no-wall open offices are all the rage, and Facebook brags that its new building will be the largest open floor plan in the world, consisting of a single, &lt;em&gt;ten acre&lt;/em&gt; open room.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What is Code Coverage Good For?</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/13/what-is-code-coverage-good-for/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-13T02:15:08-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/13/what-is-code-coverage-good-for</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Code coverage is a software development metric that measures how much of your code is covered by your tests. There are a few different ways to calculate it, but the most basic just instruments your code so that when a line is executed, it is logged. Then you run your tests, parse the log and any line that wasn&amp;rsquo;t executed is not covered by your tests. Simple right? Well, yes and no &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above style of code coverage is called &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; coverage because it covers code line-by-line or in blocks. It works great for straight-line code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;because it tracks which lines were executed. But if you run into code like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;baz&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can get 100% code coverage and still not test the entire function. How, you ask? Well, every modern programming language has some type of short-circuit Boolean evaluation, flow control mechanism or even strange parameter passing artifact that means sometimes an entire line isn&amp;rsquo;t executed. For example, in the code block above if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is true then the function &lt;code&gt;y(x)&lt;/code&gt; never gets called. The opposite is true of &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;baz&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is false, then &lt;code&gt;baz&lt;/code&gt; is never evaluated. But in both cases, line coverage will count this block as 100% covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we could solve this problem with &amp;ldquo;branch&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;arc&amp;rdquo; coverage. Branch coverage instruments code at a deeper level, ensuring that each and every path (or arc) through the code is covered. So in the block of code above there are 5 arcs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is true, &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is true, &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is true, &lt;code&gt;baz&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is false, &lt;code&gt;y(x)&lt;/code&gt; is true, &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is false, &lt;code&gt;y(x)&lt;/code&gt; is true, &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is true, &lt;code&gt;baz&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is false, &lt;code&gt;y(x)&lt;/code&gt; is false&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if we only cover arc #1, line coverage would say that we have achieved 100% coverage. But as we can see, we&amp;rsquo;ve only achieved 20% coverage of the code paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, great! I&amp;rsquo;ll just use arc coverage then! Except &amp;hellip; the vast majority of code coverage tools only provide line coverage. As a matter of fact, the only tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used that provided branch or arc coverage is &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/magellan.aspx&quot;&gt;a tool from Microsoft Research called &amp;ldquo;Magellan&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, specifically for C/C++ code on Windows. Another problem with this level of code coverage is that it is harder to visualize, highlighting only the few characters on a line that haven&amp;rsquo;t been covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there&amp;rsquo;s the Achilles heel of code coverage. It&amp;rsquo;s right there in the opening paragraph. All code coverage tracks is that you&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;executed&lt;/em&gt; a line of code. It has no way of telling if you actually &lt;em&gt;tested&lt;/em&gt; that line of code. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;describe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;mult&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;multiplies two numbers&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:tada: 100% code coverage is achieved!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the above examples are of obviously degenerate cases. But each and every one of these examples are simplifications of errors I saw in tests of production code. Production code that our code coverage tool insisted we had covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; code coverage good for? Code coverage is good for identifying areas of your code that are definitively &lt;strong&gt;untested&lt;/strong&gt;. Is there a high-risk area of your application that isn&amp;rsquo;t covered? Well, get on that! But code coverage can&amp;rsquo;t tell you if any area of your code is &lt;strong&gt;sufficiently&lt;/strong&gt; tested. For that, you&amp;rsquo;ll still need to use your brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Ruby&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://rspec.info/&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/a&gt;, the test block there doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a verification step. It executes the code, but does not validate that it returns the correct answer. And if the names of the function and test are to be believed, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; returning an incorrect answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Linguist for Atom: Evaluating Accuracy</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/11/linguist-for-atom-evaluating-accuracy/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-11T14:03:23-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/11/linguist-for-atom-evaluating-accuracy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In writing a version of Linguist for Atom, it is important to be able to evaluate whether we are making things better or worse. To do that, we need to have a system for creating a numeric representation of how accurate a language classification system is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In designing this numeric system, it is important to take a look at what answers, both desirable and undesirable, we can get back from our classifier. Imagining that we have a list of languages that we can recognize &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;Z&lt;/code&gt; and a default of plain text,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; our classifier can give us the following answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language is X - Classifier answers X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language is X - Classifier answers something other than X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language is X - Classifier answers Unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could take a very simplistic view and say that answer #1 is correct and all other answers are incorrect. This is simple to create a numeric rating for, we simply use what most people think of when they think of the term &amp;ldquo;accuracy&amp;rdquo; and use the percentage of correct answers. So if our classifier gets 42 out of 100 correct, then it is 42% accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into account that in some cases there is a wrong answer that is no big deal and a wrong answer that has negative implications. In medical testing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification&quot;&gt;binary classification&lt;/a&gt; systems are often used to determine if a patient has (a positive result which we&amp;rsquo;ll call &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;) or does not have (a negative result which we&amp;rsquo;ll call &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt;) a disease. Programmers will recognize that this fits neatly into a truth table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8 col-md-offset-2&quot;&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-bordered&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Patient&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Test Result&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;success&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;P&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;P&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sick patient identified as sick or &lt;strong&gt;True Positive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;danger&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;P&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sick patient identified as healthy or &lt;strong&gt;False Negative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;P&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Healthy patient identified as sick or &lt;strong&gt;False Positive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;success&quot;&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Healthy patient identified as healthy or &lt;strong&gt;True Negative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the &lt;strong&gt;True Positive&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;True Negative&lt;/strong&gt; outcomes are the most desirable. But in medical testing, it isn&amp;rsquo;t that simple because both of the incorrect answers can have significant implications for the patients that are trusting the results of the test. A &lt;strong&gt;False Negative&lt;/strong&gt; can mean that a patient might put off life-saving treatments until it is too late. Even a &lt;strong&gt;False Positive&lt;/strong&gt; can mean social stigma for a patient that is incorrectly identified as having a disease such as AIDS or syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the medical classification systems are generally &amp;ldquo;binary&amp;rdquo; classifiers in that they are attempting to determine which of two possible answers to return, positive or negative. Our language classifier could return one of \(n+1\) answers with \(n\) being the number of languages our system can recognize.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But there is still only one correct answer.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So how do we apply the system of True and False, Positive and Negative to our more nuanced system? I haven&amp;rsquo;t found literature on this,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but this is the system I&amp;rsquo;ll use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifies X as X &amp;mdash; True Positive or Correct Identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifies X as not X &amp;mdash; False Positive or Incorrect Identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifies X as Unknown &amp;mdash; False Negative or No Identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could potentially add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifies Plain Text as X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifies Plain Text as Unknown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I think this would unnecessarily complicate things by requiring that I create a corpus of plain text files as well as the corpus of actual language files. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think that it would provide a commensurate benefit in determining the accuracy of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what these types of answers mean as far as their impact on the user experience in Atom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct Identification &amp;rarr; Correct grammar loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect Identification &amp;rarr; Incorrect grammar loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Identification &amp;rarr; Null grammar loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both the null grammar and an incorrect grammar being loaded means the same corrective action is required of the user, to go to the grammar selection menu and select the correct one, the incorrect grammar being loaded means that it might &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; that the correct grammar is loaded until the error is detected later. Later detection may be after extra frustration has been incurred by expected functionality not showing up or working, incorrect snippets being expanded, etc. This means to me that a Correct Identification result is good, an Incorrect Identification result is bad and a No Identification result is neutral. So I&amp;rsquo;ll use the following point system:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct Identification = +1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorrect Identification = &lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Identification = 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if our system is given 100 files to classify and it identifies 42 of them correctly, 23 of them incorrectly, and the rest it does not identify, this would come out to 42-23 = 19 points out of 100 or 19% accurate. This also means that a classifier implementation could have a negative accuracy. I think this is completely valid since it would mean that the implementation is giving an incorrect answer more often than a correct one, making it misleading like the car navigation system that tells you to drive off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I have a couple of implementations to compare, a corpus of example source code files, and the list of correct answers for the entire corpus, I&amp;rsquo;ll create a test harness to execute the tests and give the accuracy values in this format. I think the data will be interesting to analyze!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atom considers plain text files to be the default. In the source code, the plain text grammar is referred to as the &amp;ldquo;null grammar&amp;rdquo;. Despite this, there is actually a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/language-text&quot;&gt;plain text grammar&lt;/a&gt; that is loaded as the null grammar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of systems are referred to as &amp;ldquo;multiclass&amp;rdquo; classifiers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a file may contain &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.atom.io/t/better-syntax-highlighting/7176&quot;&gt;multiple languages&lt;/a&gt;, as far as Atom is concerned there is only one grammar loaded to handle a particular file. So we need to concentrate on identifying the &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; language in a file.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I confess to not looking too hard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has taken an SAT preparation course will recognize this kind of point system, where giving &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; answer is better for your ultimate score than giving an incorrect one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Converting Linguist for Atom</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/10/converting-linguist-for-atom/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-10T17:38:47-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/10/converting-linguist-for-atom</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting (but lesser known) bits of technology that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; has released upon the world is a library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/linguist&quot;&gt;Linguist&lt;/a&gt;. Linguist is used to determine the primary language in any programming source code file. It checks the file name, some basic heuristics and then resorts to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier&quot;&gt;Bayesian classification&lt;/a&gt; to get the list of candidates down to one and only one result. This would be very useful for Atom so that it could be hyper-accurate in its guess of what language someone is editing so that all of the grammar-dependent language features would work automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge here is that Linguist was designed to run as a server process using Ruby. It may take liberties with the amount of time taken and memory used that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be appropriate for use in Atom. But, in order for it to be usable in Atom in the first place, it needs to be converted to CoffeeScript.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This is my plan for converting Linguist so that it can be used in Atom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the bare-minimum implementation of Linguist in CoffeeScript as a Node module using Linguist&amp;rsquo;s own data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare accuracy of Atom&amp;rsquo;s current algorithm against atom-linguist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare performance of Atom&amp;rsquo;s current algorithm against atom-linguist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize performance, if necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially rewrite Linguist&amp;rsquo;s data structures to something more Atom-native&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/first-mate&quot;&gt;first-mate&lt;/a&gt; to use atom-linguist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this idea will consume too many resources for only marginal benefit over Atom&amp;rsquo;s built-in algorithm. But I think this ability would be useful for Atom in too many places to not at least give it a shot. I&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting each stage as they are completed and posting them here. I think it will be interesting reading as I discover how to profile and analyze JavaScript performance and memory usage. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I just use the Ruby library? Because Atom has specifically avoided adding any dependencies on languages other than CoffeeScript and a few native-compiled libraries that are guaranteed to be available cross-platform. If I want to eventually include atom-linguist in Atom itself, then it needs to be a Node module.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linguist uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yaml.org/&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; to store a lot of the metadata around known languages. Atom uses a similar, but incompatible, format called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/cson-safe&quot;&gt;CSON&lt;/a&gt;. There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a need to have both libraries installed, so atom-linguist should use CSON.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Writing Good Bug Reports</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/04/writing-good-bug-reports/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-04T14:37:46-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2015/01/04/writing-good-bug-reports</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there is only one thing that is true about all computer science, it is that every program beyond &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo; has bugs. And when a bug happens, you want it to get fixed. You know what the best way to get a bug fixed is, whether it is someone else&amp;rsquo;s or your own? Writing a good bug report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people think that writing a good bug report is just writing a couple of sentences describing the problem and that&amp;rsquo;s it. The issue is that they&amp;rsquo;ll write something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I did to break it, but &amp;ldquo;Open in dev mode&amp;rdquo; is now opening files in the same window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually describe the issue though. There are multiple ways to execute that command and it turned out in this case that &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.atom.io/t/open-in-dev-mode-opens-in-same-window-on-os-x/14026/4?u=leedohm&quot;&gt;one of the ways worked and another was broken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of reporting a bug is &lt;em&gt;to get the bug fixed&lt;/em&gt;, otherwise why report the bug at all? So your goal in writing a bug report should be to make it as easy as possible for the developer to fix the bug. You can point fingers and argue over whether it should be the developer that is responsible for doing the legwork, not the user. But when it comes right down to it &amp;hellip; if you&amp;rsquo;re the first person reporting this bug, it may well be that there is something peculiar about your setup, how you perform the task, your machine or something really crazy that the developer &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; replicate without help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In development circles one of the jokes about the lazy programmer is, &amp;ldquo;It works fine on my machine!&amp;rdquo; Great &amp;hellip; whoopee for you! Are we going to send your machine to all five hundred of our customers so they can each get their turn? No, didn&amp;rsquo;t think so &amp;hellip; so get off your ass and fix it. Well, I&amp;rsquo;m also here to say that a bug report consisting only of &amp;ldquo;X is broken on my machine&amp;rdquo; is just as lazy and unhelpful and deserves to be deprioritized into oblivion. We&amp;rsquo;ll get back to it when all the other bugs are fixed, thankyouverymuch &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that we know a little about why to write a good bug report, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how. The absolute bare minimum things to include are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include steps to reproduce the problem as reliably as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include what you expected to happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include what actually happened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other helpful things to include like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What OS and version of the OS you&amp;rsquo;re running (especially if the program is cross-platform or you&amp;rsquo;re using an unreleased version of the OS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What versions of other related software you have installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your software environment (like your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable, how much RAM you have, is your system low on disk space)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, almost any information you provide &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; help. So if you have time, provide more. It can only help your chances of getting your bug fixed before someone else&amp;rsquo;s. But let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the minimums &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Repro Steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, everyone reading this has heard of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrpa.org/blog/how-to-make-a-peanut-butter-and-jelly-sandwich-a-speed-session-preview/&quot;&gt;peanut-butter and jelly sandwich exercise&lt;/a&gt;. The one where you get a bunch of people to write a list of instructions on how to make a peanut-butter and jelly sandwich. Then you read the instructions and interpret them more or less literally&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to show them how badly things can go wrong, especially as misinterpretations are compounded. The same is true of repro steps in a bug report. You have to be really clear about what you&amp;rsquo;re doing because if there is more than one way to do something &amp;hellip; if you&amp;rsquo;re writing the bug report, you&amp;rsquo;re probably doing it differently than other people. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a relatively simple task, opening a file. Most people would write it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a better example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a file in the &lt;code&gt;HOME&lt;/code&gt; directory using &lt;code&gt;touch test.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the application by double-clicking on its icon&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for the application to finish loading and the cursor to start blinking in the open editor&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Open File dialog by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;⌘O&lt;/kbd&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the &lt;code&gt;HOME&lt;/code&gt; directory by clicking the appropriate folder in the sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click the &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; file in the dialog&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn7&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are a lot of assumptions that go into how one opens a file, something that most people consider to be the most basic of operations. And each of these assumptions can be the key to helping the developer track down the bug and fix it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be discouraged by the excruciating detail in the repro steps though. A lot of bug reports for &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; include an animated GIF as their repro steps&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn8&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it serves just as well, sometimes better! So even if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with language issues, you can still be specific and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Expected and Actual&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being specific about what you &lt;strong&gt;expected&lt;/strong&gt; to happen and what &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; happened is also very important when writing a good bug report. Almost always, people will describe only one or the other. They will describe what actually happened, thinking that what they expect to happen is obvious. Or they will describe what they expected to happen, assuming that of course you can reproduce the actual issue exactly as they have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, sometimes it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; clear what is expected to happen &amp;hellip; like when the application crashes or some crazy exception dialog appears.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn9&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; You expect the application to not crash and not show dialogs with bunches of text and just an &lt;code&gt;Ok&lt;/code&gt; button at the bottom. But these are (hopefully) pretty rare and most of the time good applications have crash-reporting systems built into them that give far more information about what was going on in the application at the time than you could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/1626&quot;&gt;an example&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When soft wrapping, the cursor gets behind by one character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of weak even for an actual. What do you mean by &amp;ldquo;soft-wrapping&amp;rdquo;? Do you mean when you toggle soft-wrap mode on? Do you mean when it is already on and a line becomes soft-wrapped by typing more characters into it? What does it mean for the cursor to &amp;ldquo;get behind by one character&amp;rdquo;? Here&amp;rsquo;s a much better explanation (based on the one in the actual bug report):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place where the cursor is displayed and the place the cursor actually is becomes different after toggling soft-wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows the developer to know exactly what to look for and a much better idea of how to reproduce the issue. And it really wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have taken that much more effort to write twice as many words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all would rather be using software that has fewer bugs. Yes, it can be frustrating to pay for software (though that is becoming less and less common, really) and then have it not work. And whether you think of it as catching more flies with honey than vinegar or just from a utilitarian point of view, taking the extra effort to write a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; bug report, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to make the effort at all, just makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it may have only been broken on the reporter&amp;rsquo;s machine. After they built from the latest &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; version, everything worked fine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it done both in hilariously comic interpretations or just plain asinine interpretations &amp;hellip; the point comes across either way, I guess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents or location of the file being opened might be important. Or even the fact that the file exists &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the application is launched, rather than the file being created after the application is launched.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because maybe you can open the program from either the icon or the command line and &lt;a href=&quot;http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/87282/in-mountain-lion-how-do-i-set-in-one-place-the-path-environment-variable-for-a/87283#87283&quot;&gt;it behaves differently depending on how you launch it&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there can be timing issues with people trying to click on something &amp;ldquo;too fast&amp;rdquo; or even the fact that an editor view is open (so that a cursor is shown and blinking) could be the difference.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe there is a difference between opening a file using the key combination and opening a file using the &lt;code&gt;File &amp;gt; Open&lt;/code&gt; menu.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref6&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-clicking the file might behave differently than single-clicking the file and then clicking the &lt;code&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt; button.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref7&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn8&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the Atom contributors use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cockos.com/licecap/&quot;&gt;LICEcap&lt;/a&gt; as the tool of choice for capturing animated GIFs of repro steps. It&amp;rsquo;s available for both Windows and OS X.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref8&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn9&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you expect &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/4688&quot;&gt;the menu to not turn blue&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref9&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Crossy Road: An Allegory for the Futility of the Working Class in a Capitalist Economy</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/12/14/crossy-road-as-an-allegory-for-the-working-class/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-14T13:56:54-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/12/14/crossy-road-as-an-allegory-for-the-working-class</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossyroad.com/&quot;&gt;Crossy Road&lt;/a&gt; is the latest iPhone game craze. It has been described, aptly in my opinion, as &amp;ldquo;endless &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger&quot;&gt;Frogger&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it more and more over the past few days since it is simple and fun and, being an iPhone game, is always in my pocket. Just this morning as I was playing, I had an epiphany and thought I would share it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is very simple. You play as any of a number of characters, the default being the proverbial chicken. You have to get your character as far as you can across dangerous terrain of roads, train tracks and rivers without getting smooshed. Roads have cars, trucks and other automobile-type vehicles of varying speeds. Train tracks have high-speed trains (though there is always a crossing warning). Rivers have stationary lily pads and moving logs that you have to use to get across. The further you get, the harder it is to safely move forward. If you ever stop moving, the &amp;ldquo;chicken hawk&amp;rdquo; (at least that&amp;rsquo;s what I call it) comes to grab you and take you away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;youtube-embed&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/a3pTw0jmxlg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been getting press about this game so far (besides the fact that it is darned good fun) is that it is a &amp;ldquo;freemium&amp;rdquo; game, i.e. it is free to download and play but you can pay real-world money to &amp;ldquo;upgrade&amp;rdquo; the experience. Most freemium games have a &amp;ldquo;pay-to-win&amp;rdquo; model of some level. They do this by offering items or power-ups that help you win easier. And a lot of times, winning is tied with discovering new content. You can play without paying a cent and eventually see everything the game has to offer, but it will take you a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; longer than if you pay a little money. And once you pay a little money, even just ninety-nine cents, it gets a lot easier to pay a little more, and a little more, and a little more.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But Crossy Road doesn&amp;rsquo;t employ this traditional kind of freemium pricing model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossy Road&amp;rsquo;s freemium pricing model is all about getting new characters to play as. These new characters are almost completely cosmetic. If anything, they make the game &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; to play by changing the environment to match the character, making it darker or harder to see. You can obtain the new characters by either paying 99&amp;cent; or by using coins. You obtain coins by picking them up as you play, by watching short ad videos, or periodically the game gives you some as a gift. And this is the part that had me thinking of economic models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the point of the game is to get as far as you can before you die. Ultimately, the one that comes after you starts over at the beginning. If you work hard, you might get some coins, maybe some will be given to you for one reason or another. All the coins do for you, however, is change the trappings of your short life. They do nothing to improve your station, allow you to get further, free you from the treadmill or prevent your ultimate demise under the wheels of &amp;ldquo;progress&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

It really deserves a read, but I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize it down to: You can&amp;rsquo;t negotiate, debate, argue or even have a meaningful discussion with a mob that has no structure.

   <title>Lessons in Open Source</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/11/26/lessons-in-open-source/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-26T14:28:40-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/11/26/lessons-in-open-source</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the day shortens, especially here in the Pacific Northwest, and the year draws to a close, it is natural to start thinking about the lessons learned, the highlights and the lowlights of the past twelve months. One of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve devoted a major chunk of my time to in 2014 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, the new programmer&amp;rsquo;s editor from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I got involved in late February and have been a moderator on &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.atom.io&quot;&gt;Discuss&lt;/a&gt;, the official forum, since early March. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about participating in Open Source over the past nine months and I wanted to share those lessons, in case it would help others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Better to Ask Forgiveness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed, first in myself and then in others, is that people who are used to working in corporate or business environments often feel the need to ask permission before they start work on something. They&amp;rsquo;re often concerned about &amp;ldquo;wasting time&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;will it be helpful&amp;rdquo;. This is a behavior anti-pattern even in some business settings &amp;hellip; but especially so in Open Source efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most small- to mid-sized ideas just don&amp;rsquo;t need any discussion before work starts. If there is a bug, just fix it. Once you have a fix coded, then the discussion can happen on how to refine the fix or tweak it, if necessary.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If there is a feature to be added, just add it. Most often it will be accepted as-is and then added upon over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For really big ideas, features or bug fixes, there may be some discussion that has to happen. But it is almost always &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; a significant chunk of coding has happened. As has been said before, developers communicate best with code. So write some code and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; seek out feedback, tweak tweak tweak and keep the ball moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Open Source projects &lt;strong&gt;progress&lt;/strong&gt; is the name of the game. You&amp;rsquo;re either a contributor or you&amp;rsquo;re just someone who is talking. And if you&amp;rsquo;re just talking, the best you can hope for is that you&amp;rsquo;ll give an idea to someone who &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a contributor. Don&amp;rsquo;t be a talker, become a contributor.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of contributing &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Give Back&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first got started with doing stuff with Atom, I just wrote things for myself. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother to build them into packages or themes or other such things because I didn&amp;rsquo;t think anyone else would find what I built useful. It was never &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; to share. It was never &amp;ldquo;comprehensive enough&amp;rdquo; to be merged into &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt;. And sure, maybe the very first version wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; for absolutely everyone or didn&amp;rsquo;t cover enough edge cases to be &amp;ldquo;full featured&amp;rdquo; or whatever you want to call it. But I learned that the first version doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started with Atom, I&amp;rsquo;ve published &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/users/lee-dohm/packages&quot;&gt;14 packages and 2 themes&lt;/a&gt;. Most of them are just tiny little things that don&amp;rsquo;t do much. They add a command or two, add an indicator to the status bar for this or that, change the icons in the tree view to give more visual indication of the file type, etc. Each of them started as something that I wanted for myself&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and they grew little by little over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will help your code become &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo; fastest is &lt;em&gt;other people using it!&lt;/em&gt; Other people filing bugs because they found an edge case that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. Other people asking for a feature that you hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of that makes you think of other features you could add. Other people giving feedback on your code, suggesting ways it could be faster, better, more maintainable. This is one of the benefits of Open Source and, honestly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review&quot;&gt;peer-review systems&lt;/a&gt; in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating add-ons is one way to give back but also sometimes it makes sense for your idea to be part of the original project. Don&amp;rsquo;t keep ideas to yourself just because you&amp;rsquo;re afraid that your ideas don&amp;rsquo;t stack up. Help your ideas get better by subjecting them to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uhf4uPruro#t=13&quot;&gt;fiery crucible&lt;/a&gt; of code reviews. Help your skills get better by getting feedback, listening and incorporating it into the next even better version of your code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Show Your Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an oft-quoted fact that the sooner bugs are found, the cheaper they are to fix. So don&amp;rsquo;t just build an idea and then share it. Share it as soon as possible using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/&quot;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;! Get just a little bit of code out there and put it up as a pull request so that you can get feedback early and often. This is often the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; method of preventing one from &amp;ldquo;wasting time&amp;rdquo; because you are both making forward progress &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; ensuring that you are not firing wide of the mark.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all of the above really boils down to is: if you want to participate in Open Source, the only thing stopping you from participating is you. So jump in with both feet, be humble, take criticism well and learn, learn, learn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: It is almost never necessary to have an extended discussion over a bug fix. It is better to simply fix the bug and then have a discussion over whether there are edge cases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can contribute in many ways other than just writing code. They can triage bugs. They can reproduce bugs. They can write documentation. They can clean up code to make it more maintainable. Heck, they can even moderate discussion boards! :grinning:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, except for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/tabs-to-spaces&quot;&gt;tabs-to-spaces package&lt;/a&gt; which was created because I got frustrated with people asking for the feature on the message board &amp;hellip; so in a fit of pique and inspiration, I just coded it up and released it one night :laughing:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see this pattern in a lot of agile process literature referred to as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cutimes.com/2012/11/20/the-ooda-loop-of-agile-decision-making&quot;&gt;OODA Loop&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>I Support Brianna Wu</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/10/21/i-support-brianna-wu/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-21T20:48:42-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/10/21/i-support-brianna-wu</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been following the story, a group of people have banded behind the Twitter hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy&quot;&gt;Gamergate&lt;/a&gt; and perpetrated a number of terrorist and criminal activities. But Gamergate is just the public face of an undercurrent in today&amp;rsquo;s culture. Women developers and journalists in the electronic games community have received death threats, rape threats, their personal information has been hacked and revealed to the Internet at large &amp;hellip; the list goes on and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brianna Wu, head of development at &lt;a href=&quot;http://revolution60.com/&quot;&gt;Giant Spacekat&lt;/a&gt; and a host of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://isometricshow.com/&quot;&gt;Isometric podcast&lt;/a&gt;, drew the attention of this underbelly in the past week and became their latest target:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was literally watching 8chan go after me in their specific chatroom for Gamergate,&amp;rdquo; [Brianna Wu] told Kotaku today. &amp;ldquo;They posted my address, and within moments I got that death threat.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/another-woman-in-gaming-flees-home-following-death-thre-1645280338&quot;&gt;Kotaku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I mean it when I say that she is the latest target. Other targets have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beesgo.biz/index.html&quot;&gt;Zoe Quinn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.feministfrequency.com/&quot;&gt;Anita Sarkeesian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/it-doesnt-get-better-women-internet/&quot;&gt;Samantha Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a few of the ones &lt;em&gt;we know about&lt;/em&gt;. There have been many, many more that haven&amp;rsquo;t made their stories public or haven&amp;rsquo;t been public figures to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This criminal, misogynist behavior is nothing new in the tech industry. Over seven years ago, in March of 2007, Kathy Sierra, a co-creator of the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_First_(book_series)&quot;&gt;Head First&lt;/a&gt; series of technical books, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Sierra#Harassment&quot;&gt;canceled a speaking engagement because of exactly this kind of harassment&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently removed herself from the public Internet until just last year. Oh &amp;hellip; except she has chosen to leave Twitter just this month due to &amp;hellip; you guessed it! Even more harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She had this to say in her recent blog post about the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the first threat had nothing to do with what I actually &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt; in my books, blog posts, articles, and conference presentations. The real problem &amp;mdash; as my first harasser described &amp;mdash; was that &lt;em&gt;others were beginning to pay attention&lt;/em&gt; to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&quot;http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point&quot;&gt;seriouspony.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this seems to be the crux of it. A lot of these people seem to be upset that people are paying attention to women. People are listening to what they have to say. People are listening when these women say that something needs to change in games, gaming and the tech industry in general! What are some of these angry people doing about it? Everything in their power, legal and illegal, moral and immoral, to &lt;strong&gt;shut these women up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/brianna-wu-gamergate&quot;&gt;Brianna Wu has taken a stand.&lt;/a&gt; She has refused to back down. She has continued to speak out about these issues and, because of the attention all of this has gotten, has been given an international platform to speak out about them by being invited to speak on NBC, CBS, the BBC and many others. I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to all of this going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y&amp;#39;know what? She&amp;rsquo;s convinced me.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Things need to change. Far, far beyond the fact that this violence against and abuse of women, physical, emotional, mental, professional, financial and otherwise &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;needs to stop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The games and tech industries &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;need to become more inclusive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and beyond that they need to stop being &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actively poisonous&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; towards women and other marginalized groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How are we going to get there from here? I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet. But I&amp;rsquo;ll start with this &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I support Brianna Wu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sucks that these horrible, reprehensible actions were the catalyst that finally got me to publicly say something about this. But in my experience people&amp;rsquo;s beliefs are either influenced or chosen. And more often than not, when someone &lt;em&gt;chooses&lt;/em&gt; a belief it is because of a &lt;em&gt;personal connection&lt;/em&gt; &amp;hellip; while their beliefs are influenced subconsciously. These events have reached me on a personal level.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Taking the "P" out of PvP</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/09/05/taking-the-p-out-of-pvp/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-05T07:24:39-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/09/05/taking-the-p-out-of-pvp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things that people often request in multiplayer games is more ways to interact. They want more ways to make an impression on the environment or more ways to create a lasting impact. The problem is that a broad category of these requests are ways to create a lasting impact on other players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that the game industry has learned from the massively-multiplayer online games (MMOs) of the early 2000s, it is that allowing players to impact the gameplay experience of other players almost always results in a negative experience for the player on the receiving end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the progression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online&quot;&gt;Ultima Online&lt;/a&gt; (released in 1997) &amp;mdash; had wide-open non-consensual PvP&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; where the victor could take all of the loser&amp;rsquo;s possessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest&quot;&gt;EverQuest&lt;/a&gt; (released in 1999) &amp;mdash; had opt-in PvP where the victor could take only one possession. Non-consensual PvP was restricted to certain specific servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Camelot&quot;&gt;Dark Age of Camelot&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2001) &amp;mdash; had opt-in PvP between different &amp;ldquo;realms&amp;rdquo; but didn&amp;rsquo;t allow the victor any spoils nor were characters from different realms able to talk to each other in-game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft&quot;&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2004) &amp;mdash; had opt-in PvP&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; between different &amp;ldquo;factions&amp;rdquo; and experimented numerous times with methods to &amp;ldquo;punish&amp;rdquo; players that acted in an unsportsmanlike manner. Each and every one of them was abandoned when they were turned around and used against the people the systems were intended to protect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the trend? Now let&amp;rsquo;s jump into the recent past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forza_Motorsport_5&quot;&gt;Forza Motorsport 5&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2013) &amp;mdash; has opt-in PvP, but the game records how you drive and creates an AI version of your driving style called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/drivatar/&quot;&gt;Drivatar&lt;/a&gt;. In single-player events you&amp;rsquo;re running against the AI versions of other players every time you race. This makes it unnecessary to ever enter the true multi-player mode.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone:_Heroes_of_Warcraft&quot;&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; (released in 2014) &amp;mdash; has opt-in PvP (even if the single-player game is pretty limited) but players that haven&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;friended&amp;rdquo; each other are restricted to only six emotes for communication: &amp;ldquo;Thanks&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Well Played&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Greetings&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sorry&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Oops&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Threaten&amp;rdquo;. And even those emotes can be &amp;ldquo;squelched&amp;rdquo; by the receiving player.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game designers are now not only restricting how players interact with each other, they&amp;rsquo;re increasingly figuring out ways to distill real human participants down into essentially better AI for the entertainment of other customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are they doing this? Because it is easier to turn humans into glorified AI than it is to convince those same humans to play nice with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PvP &amp;mdash; Player versus Player, the type of activity in a game where one human player is pitted against another human player. Constrast with PvE or Player versus Environment where the human player is pitted against the game environment. Non-consensual PvP is when one can be forced into a PvP situation by another player.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were specific World of Warcraft servers that allowed for limited non-consensual PvP but only in specific locations&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drivatars can pick up somewhat aggressive playstyles from their human counterparts, but a Drivatar will never send you a threatening message or taunt you with what it purportedly did to your motherboard last night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Interview Question Pitfalls</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/08/01/interview-question-pitfalls/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-01T19:45:52-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/08/01/interview-question-pitfalls</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time over the last ten years or so interviewing programming candidates for large corporations. One of the things that it seems people like to try as an exercise is to come up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toptal.com/ruby/interview-questions&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;great programming interview questions&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. The thing is, unless you&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of interviewing and hiring of programmers, you&amp;rsquo;re probably coming up with really bad ones. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to break down some of the common pitfalls that I see first time interview question designers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; falling into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The &amp;ldquo;How Much Do You &lt;em&gt;Really&lt;/em&gt; Know About the Language&amp;rdquo; Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the questions where one is asked to recall some obscure edge-case of whatever is the interviewer&amp;rsquo;s pet language. An example of this kind of question is, &amp;ldquo;Can you declare a &lt;code&gt;virtual static&lt;/code&gt; function in C++? Why or why not?&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, whether we are the &amp;ldquo;language lawyer&amp;rdquo; on the team or not, most of us for one reason or another respect the guy that can quote chapter and verse of the C++ Language Specification. Or the gal that can rattle off the exact differences between a block, proc or lambda in Ruby without looking it up first. And a lot of times, the ones that can do this are really valued members of the team. So why not ask questions like these in interviews when trying to find great programmers? Two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correlation does not equal causation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their arcane knowledge of the language is almost never why that person is super valuable to the team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, many of the folks that have this kind of amazing recall are assets to the team. But remember the old joke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Guy:&lt;/strong&gt; It says here that people who read the Wall Street Journal make more money on average!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second Guy:&lt;/strong&gt; Where do I get a subscription?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a subscription to the Wall Street Journal doesn&amp;rsquo;t magically grant you a higher salary. Memorizing the dictionary doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you a better writer. And learning the language specification doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you a better programmer. But becoming a better programmer may help you learn the language specification :grinning: And spending all this time becoming a better programmer is what makes one a better team member. The encyclopedia-brain is just a fringe benefit :wink:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The &amp;ldquo;One-Way Hash Function&amp;rdquo; Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the question that sounds hard. But if you know the trick (or have been given the question in interviews before), it is trivial.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; An example is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count the number of set bits in a 32-bit integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the simplest to remember solutions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for this question that is also one of the more efficient is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;count_bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Accumulates the total bits set in `number`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This loop initializes the count, loops only until all bits have been cleared and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// increments the count each time through the loop.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Clear the least significant bit set&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can just remember the magic trick of how to clear only the least significant bit, then the rest is just writing a loop and returning a value. Easy peasy. All this proves is that the candidate knows a cool bit of magic or that they prepared for the interview by looking up minutia, not that they know how to write real code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Puzzle&amp;rdquo; Question&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical puzzle question is of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/How-Would-Move-Mount-Fuji-ebook/dp/B000Q67H6I/&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How would you move Mount Fuji?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; These questions were a really big deal during Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s heyday, when everyone was trying to emulate them to figure out the secret of their success. Basically, these questions are supposed to get the candidate to display to the interviewer how they think, how they attack a problem and how they handle ambiguous requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are really fun for some people, but once again, they aren&amp;rsquo;t testing whether or not you can actually write code, design a system or even puzzle out an algorithm. They only test a very simple-to-learn formula for reasoning out a vague solution to a problem. Whether you call it &amp;ldquo;napkin estimating&amp;rdquo; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;back of the envelope calculation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or just &amp;ldquo;swag&amp;rdquo;, it is not a quality that good programmers necessarily have or that bad programmers won&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So What Makes a Great Interview Question?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it you want to measure when you interview a programmer? Well, among other things, you want to measure their ability to write code. So how do you test that? You have them &lt;em&gt;write code&lt;/em&gt;! And even though we would like to think that most of what we do is awesome stuff like figuring out cool and innovative new uses for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cs.sunysb.edu/%7Eskiena/combinatorica/animations/dijkstra.html&quot;&gt;Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s Algorithm for calculating a minimum spanning tree&lt;/a&gt;, but really the majority of the code we write is just simple, straight-line code with a lot of loops and conditions.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So we really should be testing if people can do that first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeff Attwood, also known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codinghorror.com&quot;&gt;Coding Horror&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main folks behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discourse.org&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;/a&gt;, popularized the use of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/&quot;&gt;FizzBuzz&lt;/a&gt; class of questions in programming interviews in a couple blog posts where he relayed a tale that the vast majority of programming candidates just can&amp;rsquo;t write &lt;em&gt;a single line of code&lt;/em&gt;. Ever since I read that blog article, I&amp;rsquo;ve used FizzBuzz and other questions like it as a basic &amp;ldquo;Do I need to bother giving you a real programming question?&amp;rdquo; test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I come up with these questions? Well, the programming interview questions I use generally have the following qualities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They require the candidate to write code in whatever language they feel most comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are very simple-to-describe problems with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; ambiguity. One or two sentences tops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have multiple special cases. These are not &amp;ldquo;write a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop and you&amp;rsquo;re done&amp;rdquo; questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not require any special domain knowledge or if they do, I have a cheat sheet prepared and it is simple enough that it can be learned completely in less than five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are multiple good solutions to the problem, depending on the requirements. In other words, do I have unlimited memory but speed is precious or vice versa?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, one of the programming questions that I use that fits these criteria is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a function that accepts an integer as input and returns a string containing the Roman Numeral representation of that integer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a cheat sheet that explains how Roman Numerals work. I also scope it to just the integers between 1 and 3,999 if the candidate asks.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They don&amp;rsquo;t even necessarily have to finish it in the time available. I can generally see how it is going to go after they spend a little bit of time on it. In my experience, this has been a very good indicator on the candidate&amp;rsquo;s programming ability. The ones that have done well have generally been capable programmers.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn7&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, keep in mind that all of these types of questions can (and sometimes are) used by jerk interviewers as basically a way to reassure themselves of their intellectual superiority. But I feel like more often the person employing one of these just doesn&amp;rsquo;t know better questions to ask. This is why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the first part of the question is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; and the answer to the second part is that they&amp;rsquo;re mutually exclusive. &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; requires an object instance and &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; precludes the use of an object instance. :laughing:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_hash_function&quot;&gt;one-way hash function&lt;/a&gt; is trivial to compute in one direction but hard or impossible to go the reverse direction from the output back to the original input.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paraphrased from &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/109036&quot;&gt;this Stack Overflow answer&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops, &lt;code&gt;if-then-else&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is an entry-level candidate, I&amp;rsquo;ll volunteer that the range of numbers is scoped and why.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref6&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the ones that have flopped and been hired anyway generally have been poor performers in the programming arena.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref7&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>The Perfect Editor, Redux</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/05/29/the-perfect-editor-redux/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-29T11:53:05-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2014/05/29/the-perfect-editor-redux</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;About six months ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/17/in-search-of-the-perfect-editor.html&quot;&gt;In Search Of: The Perfect Editor&lt;/a&gt; talking about Emacs and how it was my latest favorite editor and why. Well, for the last month or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with and on a new editor, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what I said were my requirements for an editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started using Emacs though, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a couple more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Source&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; One of the things I really enjoyed about Emacs is that there was no part of the editor that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t change if I had a mind. It also would have solved a couple of problems I had with Sublime Text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmable&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;mdash; This is subtly different from &amp;ldquo;extensible&amp;rdquo;. An application that is extensible has specific points that are designed to be extended, but intentionally not all of the application. In Sublime Text, for example, you can customize the themes, but you can&amp;rsquo;t change when windows are opened or closed or display something other than text for a given file type. A programmable editor would allow you to change core functionality or add new types of functionality that the original author didn&amp;rsquo;t expect or intend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are a ton of things to like about Emacs, the part that just kept niggling at me was the character-mode window. This means that you can&amp;rsquo;t have a decent tree view of your project. This means that the richer formatting we&amp;rsquo;re used to in this modern age just doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist for the most part. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything big or anything that made Emacs unusable &amp;hellip; it was just a lot of little annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I heard that Atom had been announced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, I immediately took a look. It is billed as &amp;ldquo;A hackable text editor for the 21st Century&amp;rdquo;. It is built on top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chromium.org/Home&quot;&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt;, the underpinnings of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/chrome&quot;&gt;Google Chrome browser&lt;/a&gt;. It is programmed in and programmable by CoffeeScript or JavaScript. And it is styled using LESS or CSS. It uses all the web technologies that so many developers these days are familiar with to create a full-featured programmer&amp;rsquo;s text editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was definitely rough around the edges at first, but it has made great strides in the past couple months. And the package community has simply &lt;em&gt;exploded&lt;/em&gt; with new functionality and features for it. I&amp;rsquo;ve even written &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/users/lee-dohm&quot;&gt;a few of my own&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve found it really easy to write my own packages for it &amp;hellip; and the fact that there is an official and thoroughly supported &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/atom/apm&quot;&gt;package manager&lt;/a&gt; helps quite a bit too.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it satisfy all my criteria for the perfect editor? Not completely, but it is pretty close. It isn&amp;rsquo;t completely cross-platform as you still have to build it yourself for Windows or Linux. And as far as mature goes, well &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s got a long way to go to match Emacs&amp;rsquo; 35+ years! But I&amp;rsquo;ve heard Atom described aspirationally as &amp;ldquo;Emacs for the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Century&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; and I think it really does have that potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found the perfect editor for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atom team has even stated that they will make it so that people can put up their own &lt;code&gt;apm&lt;/code&gt; package repositories&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For quite some time I&amp;rsquo;ve worried that as I get older I&amp;rsquo;m less and less likely to do something really great. We all dream of doing great things when we&amp;rsquo;re young. My problem is that I never really had anything to focus me in one direction, so I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of my life going from one thing to the next. I&amp;rsquo;ve never settled down and worked on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/curlys-law-do-one-thing.html&quot;&gt;one thing&lt;/a&gt; long enough to really have any sort of magical breakthrough. Today, I stumbled across an article that says that &lt;a href=&quot;http://qz.com/177694/why-major-creative-breakthroughs-happen-in-your-late-thirties/&quot;&gt;the most common time for people to have major creative breakthroughs is in their late thirties&lt;/a&gt;. According to the charts and statements in the article, it seems that there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of chance for earth shattering ideas even into the forties and fifties. Now, what was I working on again &amp;hellip; ?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Be Excellent to Each Other</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/12/20/be-excellent-to-each-other/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-20T16:06:25-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/12/20/be-excellent-to-each-other</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In a haunt of mine, someone was pointing to, among other things, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-arrogance-bubble-2013-12&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; which talks about various examples of people in the tech industry being elitist, arrogant or myopic. The question that came out of it was what can we do, as members of the tech industry, to make the world a better place. I felt inspired to address this by correcting what I saw as flaws in the reasoning of the article and then continue by giving my advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have always been examples of myopic and/or arrogant people in every industry, in every geography, in every time, under every flag, with every race, gender (or gender identification), color and creed. It is no big revelation that they can be found in Silicon Valley or in the tech sector. No matter how we design a social, political or economic system &amp;hellip; there will always be myopic and arrogant people living and working within it. In short, one of my favorites of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niven%27s_laws&quot;&gt;Niven&amp;rsquo;s Laws&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no cause so right that one cannot find a fool following it.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Larry Niven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, no industry is actually designed to make the world a better place. Anyone who tells you different is trying to sell you something. It is not the job of any industry, the tech industry included, to make the world a better place. Industries are there to generate revenue and while they may make the world a better or worse place as a side-effect, that is not what they are for. For example, many people are outraged when Apple, Microsoft or Google do not stand up to the Chinese government and their allegedly oppressive laws. Companies are not moral beings. It is not their purpose to take a moral stand against oppression whether real or imagined. Companies exist to generate revenue for their owners &amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, while companies or industries are not moral beings, people are. So if you are asking what we, as human beings rather than as cogs in some corporate or industrial machine, can do to make a difference in the world &amp;hellip; the choices are innumerable. Pick something you believe in that helps people less fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;rsquo;t forget all the in-between times too. Be nice to your waiter. Drive slower and less aggressively. Cultivate a positive attitude. Hold the door open for other people. Let someone go in front of you in line. Smile. Be polite. Say &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re welcome&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;no problem&amp;rdquo;. Laugh and joke with random strangers more. Talk to other people in the elevator. Read your waiter&amp;rsquo;s or barista&amp;rsquo;s name tag and thank them by name. In other words, be the change you want to see in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about all of this is that it has both nothing and everything to do with technology. What I mean is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you&amp;rsquo;re hanging out by the water cooler or if you&amp;rsquo;re on Twitter or if you&amp;rsquo;ve become Lawnmower Man. If we actively strive, in everything we do, to make the world a better and more positive place &amp;hellip; then it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what the industry is or does.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Offline Documentation</title>

   <updated>2013-11-29T20:35:04-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/11/29/offline-documentation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a new tool that I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about from a couple programming podcasts I listen to. It is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://kapeli.com/dash&quot;&gt;Dash&lt;/a&gt; and it already has &lt;a href=&quot;http://zealdocs.org/&quot;&gt;an open-source competitor&lt;/a&gt; for Linux and Windows. I think it is pretty cool and I was happy to give the developer some cash to support further development of it. I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily using it for a while now, but something was always nagging at me in the back of my brain &amp;hellip; especially when I started looking into creating my own docsets for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the documentation for &lt;a href=&quot;http://kapeli.com/docsets&quot;&gt;how to create your own docsets from HTML documentation&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that it is essentially taking some HTML and CSS, creating an index of certain terms and then zipping it all up into a package. This is a pretty familiar pattern if you&amp;rsquo;ve done any research into the formats of eBooks, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511&quot;&gt;KF8&lt;/a&gt;, the latest &lt;a href=&quot;https://kindle.amazon.com/&quot;&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; book format, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idpf.org/epub3/latest/overview&quot;&gt;ePub&lt;/a&gt;, the standards organization format. I started thinking about this right at the same time as I stumbled upon the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.kapeli.com/a-sneak-peek-at-dashs-future&quot;&gt;planned feature list&lt;/a&gt; and saw that while annotation was one of the planned features, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to happen any time soon. Annotation is one of the features that is most valuable in development documentation because you can extend the documentation, you can document those little bugs or edge cases, or even just remind yourself of that cool trick you found the last time you used this particular API. But annotation is one feature that every eBook reader I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; used has. So why not use something like Kindle, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apps/ibooks/&quot;&gt;iBooks&lt;/a&gt; or any generic ePub reader to read, search and annotate our development documentation offline?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s actually an easy question to answer. While generating a Dash docset isn&amp;rsquo;t drop-dead simple, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much technical savvy to accomplish. On the other hand, the current eBook standards are horrifically complex and do not have much tool support for them. So I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect someone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t done it before, even someone quite technical, to be able to take a collection of HTML and CSS and turn out an ePub in half an hour.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is that there are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; advantages to using standard eBook readers for our documentation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Already cross-platform &amp;mdash; there are eBook readers for desktops, tablets and phones of all kinds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Already have needed features &amp;mdash; annotation, bookmarks, full-text search, highlighting, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronization, transfer and backup &amp;mdash; eBook readers have mechanisms for easily storing or transferring your eBooks and backing up annotations and other marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and there are really only a couple drawbacks: the book packages are hard to create and maintain and they have restrictions that might mean it would be hard, if not impossible, to simply package up some types of developer documentation. But these are drawbacks that can be ameliorated, if not eliminated, with the creation of some new tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposal is that we should start taking a look at the various documentation generation systems that we have, things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://yardoc.org/&quot;&gt;YARD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html&quot;&gt;JavaDoc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shfb.codeplex.com/&quot;&gt;SandCastle&lt;/a&gt;. We should add the ability to these tools to generate ePub packages. And then we can leverage the efforts of an entire industry to help us read our documentation wherever we like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least one that I would expect to work in any standard ePub reader.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>In Search Of: The Perfect Editor</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/11/17/in-search-of-the-perfect-editor/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-17T11:41:16-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/11/17/in-search-of-the-perfect-editor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; as my all-around text editor for a couple of years now. It has been really great and probably the best editor I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used up to this point. Despite this, I started checking out other editors. I started with &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; because I got an email urging me to check it out. TextMate was one of the most popular editors on the Mac platform until it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amarco.org+textmate&quot;&gt;mostly abandoned and then finally open-sourced&lt;/a&gt;. I liked some things about it, but I still had a vague feeling of unease. So I sat down and thought about what I was really looking for in an editor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Platform&lt;/strong&gt; - I liked that I was able to use Sublime Text on any OS I decided to land on and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lose that ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible&lt;/strong&gt; - Sublime Text (and TextMate as well) has a lot of flexibility offered by extensions with a huge ecosystem of people writing extensions of all kinds. I knew that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be satisfied with any editor that wasn&amp;rsquo;t at least that flexible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mature&lt;/strong&gt; - The main issue I was starting to have with Sublime Text and did have with TextMate was that they both felt like they had, for me, serious shortcomings. A complete lack of responsiveness from the author of Sublime Text on the one hand and just general rough edges in the case of TextMate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in this period of general dissatisfaction that I started listening to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyrogues.com/&quot;&gt;Ruby Rogues podcast&lt;/a&gt;. A few of the members of that podcast are avowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&quot;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; users. I also remembered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://batsov.com&quot;&gt;Bozhidar Batsov&lt;/a&gt;, the maintainer of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop&quot;&gt;RuboCop&lt;/a&gt; and the unofficial &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide&quot;&gt;Ruby Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;, is an Emacs user. So, on a lark, I decided to check it out starting with an article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://crypt.codemancers.com/posts/2013-09-26-setting-up-emacs-as-development-environment-on-osx/&quot;&gt;how to get Emacs installed and configured on OS X&lt;/a&gt;. To my surprise, I found that Emacs meets all of my above criteria and some others I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know I had &amp;hellip; with some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with what is ugly about Emacs. Emacs is ugly. Even in GUI mode, Emacs is essentially a character-mode application wrapped in a crappy X-window with hideous icons.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Emacs hasn&amp;rsquo;t made any progress UI-wise at least since the last time I looked at it about ten years ago and possibly very much progress since it was created about thirty years ago&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; :scream: If you expected &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; sort of modern GUI niceties, you are looking in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been in constant use and development for essentially the entire history of the personal computer&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Emacs has a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of anachronisms. The interface is essentially completely keyboard driven.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Even common operations require what most today would consider complicated keystroke combinations by default.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The defaults are like going back in time to a bygone era of programming editors, but not the dreamy nostalgic kind, more like when people talk about the hardships of the Oregon Trail or the Donner Party, back to a time when an editor really was just a place for you to type characters and somehow slap them into the right configuration to make a program out of them. Line wrapping splits words in the middle by default. The default color scheme is approaching the hideousness of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/07/a-tribute-to-the-windows-31-hot-dog-stand-color-scheme.html&quot;&gt;Hot Dog Stand&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s like the idea is to make it so just in case a caveman programmer from the 1970s fell into a wormhole and ends up in modern times, they would at least be able to find their way around the editor and write code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that I kept saying &amp;ldquo;by default&amp;rdquo; in the last section. This is the thing, nobody uses the defaults. Just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/search?l=Emacs+Lisp&amp;amp;q=emacs&amp;amp;source=c&amp;amp;type=Repositories&quot;&gt;simple look through GitHub&lt;/a&gt; proves that.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And the thing that has people thinking that Sublime Text is so revolutionary, that its configuration is just a bunch of JSON files, is really kind of old hat. Emacs configuration isn&amp;rsquo;t just a bunch of data files. Emacs configuration is done in &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;, a dialect of Lisp called Emacs Lisp to be specific. Back in 2010 in my article &lt;a href=&quot;/2010/07/10/the-perfect-ide.html&quot;&gt;The Perfect IDE&lt;/a&gt; I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDEs need to realize their main job is window and plugin management. The IDE is simply there to mediate the interactions between various plugins that do the heavy lifting and provide windows that let the developer see what the plugins are doing for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little did I know that there was an editor that exemplified this very ideal and had been around since just a few short years after I was born!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emacs isn&amp;rsquo;t really an editor. It is a programming language that you use to write your dream editor with. The awesome bit is that there are &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; libraries of code out there to help you. Whether you want to do it all custom to make it work just how you want or if you want to piece it together using building blocks that others have provided, my personal choice, or you simply want to start with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude&quot;&gt;some defaults that make sense to the modern programmer&lt;/a&gt; and move on from there, Emacs has you covered. And &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten frustrated with this IDE or that editor for being configurable only up to a point. Visual Studio notoriously offers the ability for one to add support for non-Microsoft languages, but the method for doing so is so arcane nobody can ever figure out how. Sublime Text and TextMate have the ability to configure their syntax highlighting &amp;hellip; but only as long as you can describe how with regular expressions.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn7&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With Emacs, all configuration is just code. Want to add support for another language? Write some code. Want to syntax highlight some stuff? Write the rules how using some code. Want to set the keybinding for your completely custom function to &lt;code&gt;Fn+Ctrl+Shift+\&lt;/code&gt;? Emacs will let you do it, with code. Want to write your own snippet management system? &lt;a href=&quot;http://capitaomorte.github.io/yasnippet/&quot;&gt;You can do that!&lt;/a&gt; Want to display Google Maps inside Emacs? &lt;a href=&quot;http://julien.danjou.info/projects/emacs-packages#google-maps&quot;&gt;There is code for that too.&lt;/a&gt; If there are limits on how you can extend Emacs, it will probably be a while before I find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is true that the first several things you configure in Emacs (with code!) are probably going to be things that drive you absolutely bonkers and make you wonder why any sane person in recent history would think &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; would be a good idea for a default. But, honestly, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that to be true to one extent or another with any editor. After that will come the obligatory installing of packages and color themes. And then another round of tweaking. But, at least in my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with an editor that is at least as capable as Sublime Text &amp;hellip; and is already more powerful in some ways. So much so that I am willing to overlook the minor warts that my tweaking has not yet been able to stamp out and really give Emacs a proper chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may be posting more on this topic in the future. So if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, keep an eye out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, that is one of the first things I learned how to turn off.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs&quot;&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, Emacs is at least 36 years old having been released initially in 1976. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git&quot;&gt;source code repository&lt;/a&gt; has revisions dating back to 1984!!! :dizzy_face:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MITS_Altair&quot;&gt;MITS Altair 8800&lt;/a&gt; was released in 1975 and is generally acknowledged as the beginning of the era of the &amp;ldquo;Personal Computer&amp;rdquo;, i.e. one that an individual could own as opposed to a corporation or a research lab.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some consider that one of its strengths. There are some minor concessions to mouse use, but they are poorly tacked on and look as out-of-place as a Klansman at a NAACP meeting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saving the current file is &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+X Ctrl+S&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;C-x C-s&lt;/code&gt; in Emacs notation). Exiting the application is &lt;code&gt;Ctrl+X Ctrl+C&lt;/code&gt;. Many other functions are keystroke combinations of three, four or even five keystrokes in length! :open_mouth:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my slowly growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/emacs&quot;&gt;Emacs configuration&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref6&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think regular expressions are enough, syntax highlight a Git commit message in the following way: The first line is the default coloring for the first 50 characters. After the first 50 characters on the first line it is the error coloring. The second line is all error coloring. The third line and beyond is an alternate coloring, no matter how long. And any line where the first character is a hash mark, &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;, uses the comment coloring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref7&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Rails Routing Discoveries</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/10/13/rails-routing-discoveries/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-13T09:33:09-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/10/13/rails-routing-discoveries</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a project using &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Rails v4&lt;/a&gt; and ran into an interesting question about which there seems to be a lot of confusion. Rails has convenient helper functions for generating REST-style links: &lt;code&gt;*_path&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*_url&lt;/code&gt;. It seems everyone is clear on the fact that the &lt;code&gt;_path&lt;/code&gt; version gives a relative path, whereas the &lt;code&gt;_url&lt;/code&gt; version gives an absolute URL. The confusion lies in when is it appropriate to use which one? The general guidance is to use paths in views and urls in controllers &amp;hellip; but there isn&amp;rsquo;t really an explanation for why. I found a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/q/2350539/1954&quot;&gt;StackOverflow question&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/a/2350837/1954&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt; that seems to answer the question, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t sound like a very confident answer and seemed to be based a bit on hearsay. So I decided to dig in and look at the various specifications and documentation and see if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure it out for myself &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://viget.com/extend/rails-named-routes-path-vs-url&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; I found the guidance that there are two situations where one needs to use the absolute URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When redirecting to another page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When switching to or from SSL (&lt;code&gt;https&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;http&lt;/code&gt; or vice versa)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than those two cases, using the relative path is fine. I&amp;rsquo;m going to skip over the SSL one because there seems to be plenty of agreement on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my earlier investigation I had already looked into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;HTTP protocol specification&lt;/a&gt; and found the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-61&quot;&gt;relevant section on redirects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.30&quot;&gt;the definition of the Location field&lt;/a&gt;. The specification does explicitly say that an absolute URI should be used. Most people seem to be hand-waving this away saying that &amp;ldquo;modern browsers understand&amp;rdquo; if you use a relative path, which is fine for them I guess. I don&amp;rsquo;t like making a potential bug for myself later on by using undocumented features if I don&amp;rsquo;t have to. So I kept looking to see if I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I looked specifically at &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Redirecting.html#method-i-redirect_to&quot;&gt;the documentation for the Rails &lt;code&gt;redirect_to&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt;. It states that the first parameter can take one of a few forms. There are actually two entries in that list regarding &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; objects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; starting with &lt;code&gt;protocol://&lt;/code&gt; (like &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;) or a protocol relative reference (like &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;) is passed straight through as the target for redirection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; not containing a protocol - The current protocol and host is prepended to the string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is our answer. The Rails &lt;code&gt;redirect_to&lt;/code&gt; method automatically converts our relative paths into absolute urls for the Location field in the redirect response.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So we only need to use an absolute URL when changing protocols or when an absolute URL is truly needed (like a link in an email or something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as in your configuration the URL is just the path with the protocol and host prepended, but this is the default configuration so it will be the common case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Line Length Guidelines</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/09/14/line-length-guidelines/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-14T16:10:09-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/09/14/line-length-guidelines</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I contribute as I can to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide&quot;&gt;Ruby Style Guide&lt;/a&gt; maintained by &lt;a href=&quot;http://batsov.com&quot;&gt;Bozhidar Batsov&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most hotly debated topics is the guideline of keeping lines of code to eighty characters or fewer. Bozhidar even discussed maximum line length in &lt;a href=&quot;http://batsov.com/articles/2013/06/26/the-elements-of-style-in-ruby-number-1-maximum-line-length/&quot;&gt;his first blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining the reasoning behind some of the guidelines. He, and the commenters on that post, bring up some points in support of the eighty-character limit but I wanted to take a look at &amp;ldquo;representative&amp;rdquo; code and see what line length people naturally kept themselves within. I believe most good coders naturally keep themselves to shorter lines except when they need to have a longer line to properly express an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem was how to find representative code. I naturally turned to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; to use their new API for search to get the list of the ten most popular Ruby projects. Most popular is defined as having the most &amp;ldquo;stars&amp;rdquo;, a mechanism on GitHub whereby people mark a project as a favorite of theirs. The more favorites, the more popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had a corpus of code to look at, I wanted to ensure reasonably easily that I was looking at &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt;. So I excluded all lines that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consist solely of whitespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consist solely of comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contain only the keyword &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exceed 200 characters in length&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some messing around I built a program to query GitHub, download the latest version of the code and parse all the files. You can find my project on GitHub: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/line-length-miner&quot;&gt;Line Length Miner&lt;/a&gt;. When I ran the script, these are the results I found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count: 257,344 lines examined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mean: 44.73162 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standard Deviation: 42.37547&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;95&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: ~90 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;99&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: ~123 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;99.9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile: ~176 characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentile of 80 characters: 91.82262&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentile of 100 characters: 96.88238&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentile of 120 characters: 98.81598&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percentile of 132 characters: 99.31609&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is the histogram of the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/line-length.svg&quot; alt=&quot;Histogram of the lengths of lines of code from the top 10 Ruby projects on GitHub&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would appear that the length of lines of code do not follow specifically a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution&quot;&gt;normal distribution&lt;/a&gt;, though we could still use a normal distribution to approximate it. Because I wanted to have things be as accurate as possible, for all my percentile calculations I worked directly from the dataset and did not approximate based on the mean and standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting thing to note is that representative Ruby code has a hard time staying under eighty characters. If we were to force all ten projects to stay within eighty characters, no exceptions, over eight percent of their code would need to be touched &amp;hellip; over twenty thousand lines! :fearful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if the line length limit shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be eighty characters, what should it be? The vast majority of code can stay within 132 characters, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think it should be any higher than that. And only the tiniest fraction less code can stay within 120 characters. So it is really a choice between 100 and 120 characters for Ruby code. 100 to allow those with small monitors to be able to work more easily or 120 to err on the side of permissiveness. I&amp;rsquo;ve reconfigured my editor for 100 characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assumption here is that lines that are beyond 200 characters in length aren&amp;rsquo;t actually lines of code, but strings or other encoded data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Bioshock Infinite</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/09/02/bioshock-infinite/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-02T15:01:34-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/09/02/bioshock-infinite</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny. The previous iterations of the Bioshock franchise were often cited as the impetus behind me swearing off FPS games. Not because they were bad games, but because I had been growing tired of the genre for quite a while. I just felt like that whole style of gaming had been completely tapped out. I thought I wanted something deeper, something with more strategy, more options &amp;hellip; rather than just running around like a goofball shooting at anything that moved. It turns out that isn&amp;rsquo;t really what I wanted at all. What I really wanted was a great story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Bioshock Infinite has a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; great story. But since I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you about the story, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the two game mechanics that really make the game stand out from all the others, Elizabeth and fluid &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AI behind Elizabeth is really amazingly good. Much of the time in games, AI sidekicks are at best worthless or far more commonly net negatives. I never &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; got annoyed with her the entire game. And I was amazed at how she was developed as a character throughout. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt so emotionally connected with a video game character since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_IV&quot;&gt;Ultima IV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The story and relationship developed slowly, surely. By the middle of the game, I was hooked. The times when the storyline took her away, I was eager and almost frantic near the end of the game to get her back &amp;hellip; and not just because she provides advantages in combat and out. I wanted to save her. I wanted to rescue her. Contrast this with the sidekicks I got in Skyrim &amp;hellip; that I took to my house and told to stay and never spoke to again. Elizabeth is the standard by which AI companions will be measured in their behavior for quite some time to come. And she is the standard by which storyline companions &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other feature is how &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; is handled in the game. When your opponents overwhelm you and you fall in battle, a very quick cutscene is displayed, showing Elizabeth reviving you (or a dream sequence when Elizabeth is not with you). It is a very minor setback typically, at least on the Normal difficulty level. Many people say that this is a drawback, that it &amp;ldquo;casualizes&amp;rdquo; the game to the point of absurdity. For a game that is so focused on the &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;, I think it is perfect. If you want a game that makes you slog through encounters, that makes you soldier on, that makes you scream your fool head off when you finally make it through a level &amp;hellip; look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.l4d.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preparetodie.com/&quot;&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m glad I had the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; to play the game this way. That&amp;rsquo;s what I really find disingenuous about the complaints. Is every game that offers an &amp;ldquo;Easy&amp;rdquo; mode &amp;ldquo;casualizing&amp;rdquo; the game? No. So, play on Hard or 1999 Mode and STFU :laughing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bioshock Infinite really is an amazing game. It has a great and compelling story. It has innovative mechanics. It is approachable but still has difficulty for those that want or need it. Everyone should play it. Even if they don&amp;rsquo;t like first person shooters &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 14 when I played it. I got sucked into the story. At one point, your party of adventurers is captured and one of them is put on a chopping block. It just so happens that the one that was picked was the one I had become most attached to. The evil mastermind asked three questions &amp;hellip; that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answers to &amp;hellip; each time, the pendulum ax getting closer to killing my fellow party member. Until finally, the ax fell &amp;hellip; killing them. And the game automatically saved &amp;hellip; so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t ever get them back without starting over. I was devastated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell &amp;hellip; the Dark Souls website is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.preparetodie.com&quot;&gt;http://www.preparetodie.com&lt;/a&gt;! :scream:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Installing PostgreSQL for Rails development on OS X</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/09/01/installing-postgresql-for-rails-development-on-osx/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-01T11:48:09-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/09/01/installing-postgresql-for-rails-development-on-osx</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit: Some of the commands below have changed from their initial versions to reflect things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned since getting it all up and running. It has also been broken out into sections.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m playing around with writing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; application, just to learn new things. At the same time, I wanted to understand why everyone in the Rails community seems to be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heroku.com&quot;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;. And since Heroku defaults to using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org&quot;&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; for the database backend when you use Rails, I have to now set up a PostgreSQL environment on my Mac for development. This turned out to be harder than I first expected. This is how I got it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I had to realize that PostgreSQL doesn&amp;rsquo;t just magically get installed when you create a Rails application that is configured to use it :wink: This was pretty easy because the first time I attempted to launch the &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo; type thing I had written I got the pretty red Rails error message page saying it couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to the database. I quickly googled&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for instructions on how to properly install PostgreSQL for Rails development on the Mac and was quite happy to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2271069/installing-postgresql-on-osx-for-rails-development&quot;&gt;a StackOverflow answer&lt;/a&gt; for this very issue. I thought I was done, but it seems that as the answer was posted over three years ago &amp;hellip; let&amp;rsquo;s just say that the contents may have settled during transit :laughing: But I was able to use it as a template for how I got things to work and each time I got stuck, it helped me find my way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation and Configuration of PGSQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of downloading the installer and using that, I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; to install PostgreSQL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;brew install postgresql
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I needed to initialize a database environment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; since PostgreSQL needs you to tell it where to put the databases you create. The Homebrew recipe was kind enough to give me the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I started the server using the command that &lt;code&gt;initdb&lt;/code&gt; conveniently handed me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-pg-ctl.html&quot;&gt;pg_ctl&lt;/a&gt; command to start and stop the server process in the background. But for today, this was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Configuration of the Project to Work with PGSQL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I could actually start messing around with the server and getting things to communicate between Rails and PostgreSQL. Or so I thought. It turns out that Rails, by default, attempts to communicate with PostgreSQL via domain sockets. This is a good thing because they&amp;rsquo;re system local and &lt;a href=&quot;http://momjian.us/main/blogs/pgblog/2012.html#June_6_2012&quot;&gt;are much more performant&lt;/a&gt; than TCP/IP connections. On the other hand, Rails expects the domain sockets to be created in one directory by default and my PostgreSQL installation was using a slightly different one. After taking a stab at reconfiguring the directory used, I just told Rails to connect via TCP/IP by editing the &lt;code&gt;config/database.yml&lt;/code&gt; file and adding the following line to the &lt;code&gt;development&lt;/code&gt; section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p-Indicator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;l-Scalar-Plain&quot;&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is when I started getting database errors! Progress! :sunglasses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The database errors told me first that the user Rails was trying to connect with didn&amp;rsquo;t exist. So I created it by entering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;createuser --createdb username
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user needs to be created with the &lt;code&gt;createdb&lt;/code&gt; permission so that when executing unit tests, the test database can be dropped and created. I&amp;rsquo;ve since created a &lt;code&gt;db:create_user&lt;/code&gt; Rake task in my project to perform this for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Homebrew installations it seems that all of the PostgreSQL administration commands are also symlinked to the &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; directory. Very convenient!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was complete, I could execute the standard Rails commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rake db:create
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rake db:migrate
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rails s
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to start the server and everything was up and running!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, I was really impressed with how easy everything was once I used Homebrew to install PostgreSQL. One thing led me to another and in many cases if the next step wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, it was provided in the output of the previous step. Hats off to the Homebrew and PostgreSQL folks! :beer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I supposed to capitalize it when it is being used as a verb or not? What is the convention on that? Hmmmmm &amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-initdb.html&quot;&gt;The documentation&lt;/a&gt; calls it a &amp;ldquo;database cluster&amp;rdquo;, but I find that to be a poor choice of phrase given that most people who aren&amp;rsquo;t database wonks use the term &amp;ldquo;database&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; interchangeably.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Shells and Scripting</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/08/25/shells-and-scripting/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-25T20:00:59-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/08/25/shells-and-scripting</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant chunk of my weekend playing around with a new command-line shell, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fishshell.com&quot;&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;riendly &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nteractive &lt;strong&gt;SH&lt;/strong&gt;ell. I&amp;rsquo;d seen people using it on a couple of screencasts and thought about checking it out for quite a while. I finally got around to it &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a little frustrating to work with at first because it is designed to be simpler to use and therefore friendlier than other shells, so I had to convert some of the ways I was doing things in my older shell, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zsh.org/&quot;&gt;zsh&lt;/a&gt;, to the new way of doing things. But after I got done replicating all of my environment customizations in fish, it turns out that my fish configuration is &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; simpler than the one in zsh. I was pretty impressed, so I&amp;rsquo;ve switched over my main computer and will probably switch over my work computers this week. But as I worked with it, something bothered me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that with all the progress in computers over the last few decades, we still use command-line environments that have remained largely unchanged since about the 1980s. In the 80s many people were still writing significant amounts of code in BASIC, COBOL, Fortran and other primitive languages. We have rightly done away with those archaic systems and replaced them with much more modern ones. But what languages that should have gone the way of Latin and Sanskrit do I still see people writing whole programs in? Shell scripts.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true that the scripting language in fish is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; simpler and more consistent than zsh or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/a&gt;, but I have never seen a shell scripting language that can hold a candle to even the worst modern scripting language,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; let alone one of the better ones. There is one and only one capability that shell scripting languages have that other languages can&amp;rsquo;t easily replicate: setting environment variables. But environment variables are the &lt;strong&gt;globalest&lt;/strong&gt; of global variables &amp;hellip; not only can they be read or written anywhere in your program like normal global variables but environment variables can be read, and if you&amp;rsquo;re writing shell scripts written, by &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; programs too! There are other ways to communicate state between programs now people! :rage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than raw capabilities programming-wise, there is one other argument for these languages of yesteryear. That is their ubiquity. Every Unix machine comes with bash already installed. Every single Windows machine and every DOS machine before that can run batch files. But it is also their ubiquity that ties them down, that ossifies them, to the point where they go for decades without changing, without keeping up with the times. And in this day and age of always-on Internet connections and easy-to-use &lt;a href=&quot;http://brew.sh&quot;&gt;package&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool&quot;&gt;managers&lt;/a&gt;, installing something better is only a few keystrokes away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at an example. I wrote some code to reorder the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; environment variable in fish. It does the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locates &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt; it:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inserts &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt; just before &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the implementation in fish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; --local bin_index &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;contains --index /usr/bin &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; --local local_bin_index &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;contains --index /usr/local/bin &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$local_bin_index&lt;/span&gt; -gt &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$bin_index&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; --erase &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$local_bin_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt; --local local_path &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;math &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$bin_index&lt;/span&gt; - 1&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; -gt 0
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;local_path &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1..&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;math &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$bin_index&lt;/span&gt; - 1&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    end
&lt;a name=&quot;line-11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;local_path &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$local_path&lt;/span&gt; /usr/local/bin

&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bin_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/usr/bin&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;local_bin_index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/usr/local/bin&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;PATH&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a reputation for being concise, so let&amp;rsquo;s not look at line counts and such.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But the &lt;em&gt;clarity&lt;/em&gt; of the code is clearly worse in fish &amp;hellip; maybe not a lot worse, but worse all the same. I don&amp;rsquo;t count this as a fault of fish shell. It isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be a general-purpose programming language and the code here is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more concise, readable, understandable and maintainable than the same thing would be in bash! The fish language is way ahead of other shell scripting languages,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but that&amp;rsquo;s not a high bar. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s on their homepage, &amp;ldquo;Finally, a command line shell for the 90s&amp;rdquo;. And they&amp;rsquo;re joking, but only just.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this all boils down to is that I&amp;rsquo;m all for shell scripts that allow you to customize your working environment. Or shell scripts that make a simple task even simpler.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; But if a shell script grows to over 20 lines of code, or you&amp;rsquo;re confronted with error handling, or you start namespacing your environment variables so they don&amp;rsquo;t clash :sob:, or you start constructing a series of libraries to manage all the shell code you have :confounded:, it is time to rewrite it in a real programming language. The command line is a great place to execute &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; commands to deal with one-off tasks&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but shell scripts are not a replacement for real code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_files&quot;&gt;batch files&lt;/a&gt; on Windows as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nominate Perl. :laughing:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I can&amp;rsquo;t resist. I&amp;rsquo;ll just put it down here in a footnote. The fish implementation is 60% larger by line count and 88% larger by character count! :scream:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the possible exception of &lt;a href=&quot;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/powershell.aspx&quot;&gt;Windows PowerShell&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though both Python and Ruby come with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL&quot;&gt;REPL&lt;/a&gt; environments that serve a very similar purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref6&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartmindcode.com/2013/08/16/loyalty-and-layoffs/&quot;&gt;a great article&lt;/a&gt; that has summarized a lot of ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve had over the years, though have not always put into practice. I consider myself a very moral person and loyal as well. I&amp;rsquo;ve often been the quintessential &amp;ldquo;company man&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; at least for the first months or years at a company. The first thing I do when I join a new company or team is drink the Kool-Aid. That tendency has faded slowly over the past couple decades though. And I hope I&amp;rsquo;m finally rid of it. Because really, unless you work for yourself, then you should be working to live &amp;hellip; not living to work.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What Does ZBB Actually Mean?</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/08/14/what-does-zbb-mean/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-14T13:33:25-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/08/14/what-does-zbb-mean</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had a discussion around the deeper meaning of the commonly used but just as commonly misunderstood software development term &amp;ldquo;ZBB&amp;rdquo; today. ZBB is a TLA&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that describes a milestone in the development of a software project. Most often, ZBB is a term used in development houses that have both a dev team and a test team. The reason why will become apparent in a bit. The process generally follows the progression: Development, Code/Feature Complete, ZBB, Deployment/Ship. So now we know that ZBB is a necessary step on the way to shipping something, but how do we know we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this blog and you&amp;rsquo;ve heard the term ZBB before, you were probably told that it was something like &amp;ldquo;Zero Bug Build&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Zero Bug Barrier&amp;rdquo;. What it stood for originally is &amp;ldquo;Zero Bug Bounce&amp;rdquo;. Yes, bounce. The reason why is a bit complicated &amp;hellip; and memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/BugBurndown.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bug Burndown Chart&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a chart of the number of bugs being tracked in a product over time. See the part where the bug count starts bouncing on the zero line at about the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;? This is where the development team has caught up with the test team and is fixing bugs as fast as the test team is finding them. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that all the bugs have been found or fixed because &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the bugs will never be found in any significant software project, let alone fixed. It just means that there are few enough bugs that the test team has caught all the easy ones and isn&amp;rsquo;t filing bugs faster than the dev team can fix them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that ZBB does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; equal &amp;ldquo;ready to ship&amp;rdquo;. That is a separate decision that has to be made based on the severity of the new bugs being found. If the test team is still finding ship-blocker level bugs during the ZBB phase, then the product is most definitely not ready to ship. But if the trickle of new bugs are little things, then perhaps it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that the first time the bug count hits zero is the ZBB, in the example here on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. But ZBB is a maintainable state when one isn&amp;rsquo;t adding more features. Often in organizations with a separate test team that is very date driven, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the development team &amp;ldquo;push for ZBB&amp;rdquo; in an effort to make the actual ZBB date match up with the planned one. Sometimes coming in on the weekend and such. But ZBB is something that one can only declare in retrospect because it is the bounce that key, not reaching zero bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you know you&amp;rsquo;ve hit ZBB when the test team agrees that they aren&amp;rsquo;t finding a lot of bugs anymore and the dev team agrees that they can keep up easily with what the test team is still finding.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Code Smells as a Code Review Language</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/08/11/code-smells-as-a-code-review-language/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-11T22:02:52-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/08/11/code-smells-as-a-code-review-language</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about code reviews lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how to make code reviews less tedious by automating as much as possible. By automating code style checks and performing simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)&quot;&gt;lint&lt;/a&gt;-like static analysis, for example. But once that job is done, what then? Once the code reviewers are freed from checking for the simple mistakes and non-conformance to standards, what is left to check for? Well, this is where code reviews can become really valuable but only when we have a quick, compact method for expressing &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the code needs to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Code Smells&amp;rdquo; is a term that was coined by Kent Beck and Martin Fowler and introduced in Martin Fowler&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/&quot;&gt;Refactoring&lt;/a&gt;. It is used to describe code that works, but may have a design flaw that will make maintaining the code in the future problematic. The reason why these are described as smells is just because one of these patterns is present doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that something is wrong. But as the code smell becomes stronger, fixing the code becomes more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where code smells can assist with code reviews is that it can be used as a sort of shorthand for describing common mistakes or poor design decisions, just like design patterns can be used to describe common useful patterns in code. Just like most developers will know what I mean when I say that a class is a Singleton, so should most developers know what I mean when I say that something smells of Duplicate Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what I have decided to do is to create a list of code smells along with descriptions and examples. I hope to, over time, turn this into the canonical list of code smells.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The war over common citizens taking pictures or recording video of police rages on. A reporter for Seattle&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thestranger.com&quot;&gt;The Stranger&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2013/07/31/police-threatened-to-arrest-me-for-taking-their-photo-last-night&quot;&gt;threatened with arrest&lt;/a&gt; for observing, taking pictures of police and asking questions on the legality or illegality of standing on public property. The best part about the article, I think, is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to make the incident any more than it is, a minor issue. In addition though, it does rightly point out that it is a minor issue indicative of a larger pattern that Seattle Police Department has already been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/spd_findletter_12-16-11.pdf&quot;&gt;investigated for at a federal level&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/07/21/reply-to-reddit-post-on-stigmatizing-obesity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the original text of a comment I made to a post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ipzt7/i_believe_obesity_as_a_result_of_overeating_and/&quot;&gt;I believe obesity (as a result of overeating and lack of exercise) should be stigmatized in the same way smoking is&lt;/a&gt;. It is posted in the &amp;ldquo;Change My View&amp;rdquo; subreddit, which is described as: For people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their view. I understand that the text below might not change other people&amp;rsquo;s viewpoints, but that&amp;rsquo;s not why I wrote it really. I wrote it because I was angry. I wrote it because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to and didn&amp;rsquo;t feel I should have to just swallow that anger and pain for the sake of &amp;ldquo;winning&amp;rdquo; an argument with those I, admittedly and possibly unfairly, imagined as a bunch of young punks that have never had to deal with adversity in their lives &amp;hellip; who have never had to struggle with or for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while I am not proud of my struggle or even maybe these words. While I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to take away from the other things that I put here on my blog by associating this with them. While I want this blog to mainly be about cerebral things rather than emotional diatribes. While I want this blog to be about things I consider interesting rather than about me. I do feel that what I felt and said is important enough to preserve &amp;hellip; and this is where I do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to reply to all the comments individually, so I&amp;rsquo;ll just try to collect my thoughts here &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight loss is hard. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/82/1/222S.full&quot;&gt;Only approximately 20% of those who lose 10% or more of their initial body weight are able to keep it off for one year&lt;/a&gt;. Keeping it off for good is even harder. Multiple studies have shown that only about 5% are successful at keeping the weight off for five years or more. All these TV shows (The Biggest Loser, Extreme Makeover Weight Loss Edition) and people posting success story pictures immediately after they lose a bunch of weight just feeds the horrible stereotype that all it takes for fat people to &amp;ldquo;fix themselves&amp;rdquo; is to &amp;ldquo;suck it up&amp;rdquo;, to &amp;ldquo;not give up on life&amp;rdquo;, to &amp;ldquo;grow a spine&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;have some willpower for once&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the person below who claims to have lost over 100 pounds, congratulations. But you&amp;rsquo;re only a &amp;ldquo;former fat guy&amp;rdquo; if you &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt; for over five years. Lots of people lose weight. I lost over 90 pounds in six months and then lost another 20 in another six months. And struggled to lose more for another six months but couldn&amp;rsquo;t lose a single pound. Then I met a woman and slowly gained all of it back over the span of about two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? There were a few reasons. Because spending time with her was more important (to me and to her) than going to the gym. Because we both made good money and we liked enjoying a &amp;ldquo;decadent&amp;rdquo; lifestyle of resorts, massages, travel and, yes, food. Because I was trying to get promoted and worked my ass off for a year and a half to make it happen (it didn&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know what&amp;rsquo;s really fucked up? I lost all that weight in a very expensive (it cost me $16K) and famous weight loss program. But what they didn&amp;rsquo;t tell me is that I had essentially reached what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.builtlean.com/2010/08/03/ideal-body-fat-percentage-chart/&quot;&gt;would be considered &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; body-fat-wise (22%)&lt;/a&gt; and didn&amp;rsquo;t really need to lose more weight to be healthy even though I was still over 300 pounds. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t they tell me? Because they are doing a long-term medical study and it skews the numbers if they tell me that I&amp;rsquo;m OK now and don&amp;rsquo;t really need to lose any more weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh? You think that over 300 pounds is still overweight? Yeah, so did I because I had been listening to all of you fuckers who don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about weight and health. I&amp;rsquo;m 6&amp;#39;2&amp;quot;, broad shouldered and barrel chested. I will never be small or lean or lithe. I could probably reach the &amp;ldquo;sunny side of 300&amp;rdquo; as I used to call it if I worked at it hard enough and long enough &amp;hellip; but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;? I was healthier than I had ever been since I was still in high school and was invited to be an Olympic swimmer. My resting heart rate was 58 and my blood pressure was 110/60. My cholesterol and triglycerides were exactly where doctors want them to be. How many of you can say the same? I was just about to turn 40 &amp;hellip; all you 20 year olds that lose 100 pounds can suck it &amp;hellip; try it again in 15 years. But I thought I had to lose more weight because &lt;em&gt;I had bought in to the stigma&lt;/em&gt;! I had bought in to the idea that I needed to look like a body builder to be socially acceptable. I had bought in to all the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_dysmorphic_disorder&quot;&gt;body dysmorphia&lt;/a&gt;-inducing crap that all of you have that makes you think it is OK to look down on people and tell them they&amp;rsquo;re worthless and then turn around and pat yourself on the back and say that you did it for &lt;em&gt;their own good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am completely responsible for my situation &amp;hellip; both initially and for slipping back into this state again after having made such progress. But don&amp;rsquo;t you &lt;em&gt;dare&lt;/em&gt; think that I am going to sit back and let you tell me I&amp;rsquo;m a bad person or there is something wrong with me because I haven&amp;rsquo;t been successful to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell &amp;hellip; why stop with obesity and smoking? How about we stigmatize &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that is deemed socially unacceptable? Do you have bad credit? Let&amp;rsquo;s send you to debtor&amp;rsquo;s prison or bring back indentured servitude! Are you a slut? You should be stripped naked and scourged in the town square. That&amp;rsquo;ll teach those women to not sleep around! Are you gay? Hell &amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_violence_against_LGBT_people_in_the_United_States&quot;&gt;a whole Wikipedia page on the things we can do to you&lt;/a&gt;! Are you black? &amp;hellip; well, how about we stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck all of you for thinking you&amp;rsquo;re better than me and that because you happen to look the way society deems more &amp;ldquo;acceptable&amp;rdquo;, most likely through no &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; effort on your part, that it gives you the right to try to make me feel worse than I already do about my current situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And one final point about what I feel is the difference in attitude between stigmatizing smoking and obesity. I think great care has been taken in the public advertising campaigns (though perhaps not in people&amp;rsquo;s internal attitudes) to stigmatize smok*ing*, not the smok*er*. What I see here is the intention to stigmatize the obese &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt;, not the habits that led there or the fact that modern processed foods are &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to be addictive or any of the other factors that make obesity a growing (ha-ha &amp;hellip; see, I can do it too fuckers) problem that &lt;em&gt;so many people&lt;/em&gt; are falling prey to. The only thing that I think will be successful in the main and in the long term is a &amp;ldquo;Love the sinner, hate the sin&amp;rdquo; approach. Support people and give them more and more ways to be healthy and let them fix their own problems their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Importance of Documenting Code</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/06/08/the-importance-of-documenting-code/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-08T16:44:35-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/06/08/the-importance-of-documenting-code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the ideas I notice gaining traction lately in software development is the notion that comments mean you failed to make your code understandable enough. And, to some extent, I agree with that. We should all be striving to make our code more readable, more understandable, not just to ourselves, but for our coworkers, the person that will be maintaining the code three years from now, and even ourselves six months from now. There are lots and lots of ways to make our code more readable that do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; involve writing a single comment. But there are comments and then there is &lt;em&gt;documentation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop quiz, hotshot! What does the following code do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;valid_color?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{3}([0-9A-Fa-f]{3})?$/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;COLOR_NAMES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;include?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a really good look. Really try to figure it out, including all of the edge cases. Now, take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/lee-dohm/5722529#file-documented-rb&quot;&gt;documented version&lt;/a&gt;. Were you right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you were able to figure out that it checks to see that &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; is a valid color. If you know enough about Ruby or other languages that it is based upon, you were probably able to determine what the code actually does. Maybe if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with CSS you would know that it could be used to validate some types of CSS-style color specifications, but because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of those cases you couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sure that was the intent. And most likely you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that it is specifically designed for SVG color specifications, which are mostly like CSS color specifications but offer an expanded list of color keywords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that, arguably, this is well-written code. How the code functions is very clear. It could probably be rewritten a couple different ways to maybe make it more clear to different types of people. The code works well enough for what it is being used. But what is missing is the context. What is missing is the higher-level intent of the code. The why is missing from the what and the how. What you get from reading the documentation is a quick understanding of the contract the code offers. And you get an understanding of where the code might be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what documentation of code does. There are some things that just don&amp;rsquo;t belong in the code itself but are still very useful for those that need to understand and maintain it. Recording and communicating these things is not a waste of time. On the contrary, it can save you and everyone else that has to work on it a lot of time and effort, especially when you amortize that over the lifetime of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Dynamic Typing Affords Testability</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/26/dynamic-typing-affords-testability/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-26T19:48:38-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/26/dynamic-typing-affords-testability</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://sebastiansylvan.wordpress.com/2013/05/25/language-design-deal-breakers/&quot;&gt;this article on language design &amp;ldquo;deal breakers&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It is a thought-provoking read despite the fact that the author and I do not agree on a couple key points. Where we do agree is with regards to memory safety, both in allocation and with respect to null references, and efficient storage reclamation. I&amp;rsquo;m much less concerned than the author about Windows support though I can understand why someone would include it in their &amp;ldquo;deal breaker&amp;rdquo; list. Where I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t agree is on the benefits of static typing and this reminded me that I had been meaning to write about dynamic typing and how it affords testability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author states in their article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of code you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to write unit tests for includes gameplay logic which gets written and rewritten twenty times before ship as the result of iteration. Having to write test harnesses and tests for all this throwaway code is madness. Then of course there&amp;rsquo;s code that&amp;rsquo;s just plain hard to unit test, such as graphics. The point is that pervasive unit testing is a fantasy - it may be feasible in some domains, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not the case everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author states that automated testing isn&amp;rsquo;t valuable in all cases. Part of that reason appears to be that the author rightly states that automated testing, even at the unit test level, is hard &amp;hellip; at least in statically typed languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s step back a moment and define our terms. A language can be considered &amp;ldquo;statically typed&amp;rdquo; if type correctness is checked at compile-time and &amp;ldquo;dynamically typed&amp;rdquo; if type correctness is not checked at compile-time.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; What it means to be &amp;ldquo;type correct&amp;rdquo; varies from language to language, so we won&amp;rsquo;t examine a more formal definition of that here. Languages like Java and Go are statically typed while languages like Ruby and Python are dynamically typed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a look at the problem from the point of view of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection&quot;&gt;dependency injection&lt;/a&gt;. Dependency injection is a very important capability in testing software in an automated fashion. This is a simple example in Java:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Stores important things into the database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-14&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; depends on some &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; to store information in the database, whether &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is a concrete class or simply an interface doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter from the point of view of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is well-factored and, for a statically typed language, easily testable. If &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is a class, we could test it this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MockB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ATest&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;storeTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-14&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;MockB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MockB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-16&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-17&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-18&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;assert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-21&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-22&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We simply create a descendant of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; that stubs out the method we want to test and supply that to the constructor of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is an interface, the code is almost identical:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MockB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in this very simplified example. If &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; had not one method, but ten or twenty then the &lt;code&gt;MockB&lt;/code&gt; for that version would be much more complicated even if &lt;code&gt;store()&lt;/code&gt; is all we wanted to override. At the very least, we would have to implement all of those methods to throw an exception of some sort.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as is sometimes the case in these situations, perhaps &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is declared in a library that we don&amp;rsquo;t have the source to recompile from. And perhaps it is declared like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Writes to the database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; keyword means that subclasses of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; cannot override the &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; What does one do in this case? Well, this is where things get weird. Because &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t implement an interface nor descend from any parent class that we can use in its stead,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we have to do some gymnastics to essentially work around the type system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;MockB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;MockB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-11&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-12&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-13&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-14&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-16&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-17&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-18&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-19&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;mock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-21&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-22&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-23&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-24&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-25&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-26&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;storeCalled&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-27&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-28&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-29&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this gets the job done. But this version of &lt;code&gt;MockB&lt;/code&gt; is now part of our &lt;em&gt;production&lt;/em&gt; code because &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; has to be rewritten to accept a &lt;code&gt;MockB&lt;/code&gt; instead of a &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;. It is going to ship with our product and could be a source of bugs. It also will be a performance hit, albeit perhaps an infinitesimally small one. Every time &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; would have called a method on &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, a check is made to see if we are testing or not &amp;hellip; a check that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need to be performed in production code. This is also a violation of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle&quot;&gt;Single Responsibility Principle&lt;/a&gt;, in that this new class is responsible both for being a stand-in for &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; as well as being responsible for affording testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a dynamically typed language though, such as Ruby, all of these concerns and code changes go away. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the Ruby version of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;line-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-6&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-7&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Stores important things into the database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;line-10&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the type of the &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; parameter doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, we can create a class that does exactly what we want, similar to the first version of &lt;code&gt;MockB&lt;/code&gt; in Java above. And better yet, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is a class or an interface, open or closed, the code for the test is the same, so all the different versions of &lt;code&gt;MockB&lt;/code&gt; that we had to worry about for Java are not necessary in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of how dynamic typing makes completely automated testing significantly easier. Static typing may catch one small class of bugs sooner, but automated testing has the potential of catching &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; classes of bugs sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ideas are separate from the concepts of a &amp;ldquo;strongly typed&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;weakly typed&amp;rdquo; language, which do not have strict definitions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java though, this might run afoul of checked exceptions depending on how we decided to do it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are similar challenges in other statically typed languages like C++ and C# where the author of a class can completely prevent subclassing as a means of providing dependency injection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Java, of course, it descends from &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t helpful here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

   <title>Alderson Loop</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/24/alderson-loop/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-24T13:46:47-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/24/alderson-loop</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Long, long ago at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.com&quot;&gt;microprocessor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; company far, far away, there were three newbie programmers. One of these was working on a bug tracking system for the team, writing it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access&quot;&gt;Microsoft Access&lt;/a&gt;. He made a mistake and created a dialog box so powerful that not only could it not be dismissed, but one had to force quit the application in order to get rid of it. The other two took to joking about it and called it an Alderson Loop after the last name of the programmer who had made the mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were all big fans of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/jargon/&quot;&gt;The Jargon File&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of computer science and software development jargon and slang. And as the story, and the term, were particularly funny, one of them decided to submit an entry for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/Alderson-loop.html&quot;&gt;Alderson Loop&lt;/a&gt; to The Jargon File as a term that they used. None of them really expected it to get in, so they forgot about it. This was 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only did it make it into The Jargon File, but since then it has been spreading over the Internet. Today it can be found on &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/alderson+loop&quot;&gt;Dictionary.com&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://codesnippets.wikia.com/wiki/Infinite_Loop&quot;&gt;wikis about programming&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/sandpad/+bug/417604&quot;&gt;bug reports&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop#Alderson_loop&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;! One of the three recently found that some people had named &lt;a href=&quot;http://aldersonloop.com/Alderson_Loop/Home.html&quot;&gt;their company&lt;/a&gt; after the, now infamous, infinite loop derivative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been a periodic, if infrequent, source of entertainment for us over the years, occasionally finding the Alderson Loop cropping up in new places, with new code examples describing the phenomena. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome that the term has caught on with so many for it to have made it so far. Even if being a part of this is my only lasting contribution to computer science, I&amp;rsquo;m proud of it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>das Keyboard: One Year Later</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/18/das-keyboard-one-year-later/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-18T13:47:50-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/18/das-keyboard-one-year-later</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I got my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional-for-mac/&quot;&gt;das Keyboard for Mac&lt;/a&gt;. I liked it so much, I got myself a second one for work. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look and see how things are now that I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some serious time with it, both at work and at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I thought would be cool would be to move the keys into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard&quot;&gt;Dvorak layout&lt;/a&gt;. This was something that, without really thinking about it, I believed would be afforded by the keyboard because they have a key puller for the darned thing. Sadly, and in retrospect I should have figured this out beforehand, the curvature of the keys when moved to a row they were not designed for is obviously misaligned, as can be seen most obviously in this picture with the slash, &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, and equals, &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, keys:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/IMG_0275.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Keys misaligned&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to decide to put the keys back in their original locations. Having them in the Dvorak order didn&amp;rsquo;t affect my typing speed or skill, but it did feel wrong and was just a little annoying. I don&amp;rsquo;t ever look at the keys anyway, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like I needed them in that layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a year of use, the keys are just as responsive and feel just as good as the day I got it. There is almost no sign of wear other than the keyboard being a bit less clean and some of the most used spots on keys being just a tad more shiny from the matte texturing wearing off a bit. I&amp;rsquo;d show you a picture, but I really ought to clean my keyboard before I try taking another close-up picture of it. Where did that key puller get to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have two complaints. They aren&amp;rsquo;t truly flaws, more just nitpicking on my part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the Mac key support could be better. The media keys are shifted to the left one position, so if you switch back and forth between this keyboard when you are at your desk and the built-in keyboard on your laptop on the go, this could be annoying. Additionally, some of the special Mac function keys require the use of the &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; key and some do not.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why the manufacturer decided to come so close to having a keyboard just like the official Apple ones and then fall short like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue I have isn&amp;rsquo;t really with the das Keyboard at all. I&amp;rsquo;ve just been noticing, as I&amp;rsquo;ve started to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; and other techniques to keep my fingers on the keyboard more often, that reaching past the arrow keys and the number pad to get to my touch pad is a bit of an annoyance. I very rarely use the number pad even when entering numbers just because I&amp;rsquo;m striving to make my workflows more fluid and keeping my fingers on the home row helps that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two above items lead me to wonder if some of these new small form factor keyboards, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&amp;amp;pid=pdkb400w&quot;&gt;Happy Hacking Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, might have the right idea. Get rid of the ten key. Get rid of the function keys. I&amp;rsquo;m not so on board with getting rid of the dedicated arrow keys, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I could adapt. I&amp;rsquo;m also not on board with spending $300-400 for a keyboard. I thought about it and I just can&amp;rsquo;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what I&amp;rsquo;m really asking for is a keyboard with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/?page_id=1458&quot;&gt;Cherry MX Blue&lt;/a&gt; key switches, with the das Keyboard materials, in the Happy Hacking layout, with unprinted keycaps (then I won&amp;rsquo;t be tempted to rearrange them), and completely reprogrammable. So if I want to swap the &lt;code&gt;M&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;N&lt;/code&gt; keys for some ungodly reason, I can. Oh &amp;hellip; and make the keys backlit. Red is my preference. I think &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I would have my perfect keyboard. While I&amp;rsquo;m waiting for that to happen, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty certain the das Keyboard is as close to perfect as I&amp;rsquo;m going to get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media keys (Back, Play/Pause, Forward, Mute, Volume Down and Volume Up) and the Sleep key require the use of the &lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; key, while the brightness controls do not.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Thoughts on Why Ruby is Awesome</title>

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/05/thoughts-on-why-ruby-is-awesome</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about various programming languages because where I work now is a fairly &lt;a href=&quot;http://memeagora.blogspot.com/2006/12/polyglot-programming.html&quot;&gt;polyglot&lt;/a&gt; kind of place. We have significant code bases in Java, Ruby and Python, and you can probably find at least some project or another in probably any modern programming language. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting the itch to learn a new language and that has made me start looking at things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haskell.org&quot;&gt;Haskell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erlang.org&quot;&gt;Erlang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.golang.org&quot;&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Go&lt;/a&gt;. But each time I start learning a new language, when I just want to implement something, I always come back to Ruby. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain some of the reasons why I&amp;rsquo;ve been choosing Ruby as the language I&amp;rsquo;m using to implement things instead of these arguably more powerful and definitely more exotic languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; This post is intended for people who are new to Ruby or want to understand more about why people seem to like it so much. If you&amp;rsquo;re already a die-hard Rubyist, you probably know all this stuff already and will be bored. Or maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll surprise you, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;One Language to Rule Them All&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most know, Ruby has some great metaprogramming capabilities and this facilitates creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_language&quot;&gt;DSLs&lt;/a&gt;. What is less known, outside of the Ruby community, is that there are Ruby DSLs for nearly everything under the sun now. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m currently using the following in just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of my projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/kangaruby/blob/master/Gemfile&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Specify the project&amp;rsquo;s dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/kangaruby/blob/master/kangaruby.gemspec&quot;&gt;Gemspec&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Describe the Gem&amp;rsquo;s metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/kangaruby/blob/master/Guardfile&quot;&gt;Guardfile&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Rules for automatically running tasks to facilitate rapid development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/kangaruby/blob/44c639518a236cd58878f0a80b9bab338960bdba/Rakefile&quot;&gt;Rakefile&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Tasks for automating building and testing the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lee-dohm/kangaruby/blob/master/grammar/sequence.treetop&quot;&gt;Treetop&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Language grammar from which a parser is built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each are linked to an example file from my project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see by looking at the files themselves, they all look somewhat similar in structure despite the fact that each is designed to perform very different functions. And this is what tripped me up when I first started learning Ruby. &amp;ldquo;Why,&amp;rdquo; said I of a couple years ago, &amp;ldquo;does Ruby need to replace everything that has been working well for so long? They replaced &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)&quot;&gt;make&lt;/a&gt; fer cryin&amp;rsquo; out loud! What&amp;rsquo;s so awesome about Rake that makes it better than make?&amp;rdquo; And when I dug into it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really see anything that made it better. It did all the same things make did. It had a system for specifying how certain types of files got built, specifying generic tasks and declaring which tasks were dependent on others. So why did everything in Ruby use Rake?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was right there, staring me in the face. The reason why Rake is better than make for Ruby projects is &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; the Rakefile is actual Ruby code. If you look at the section of the code starting at line 66, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a task that I wrote for updating the &lt;code&gt;.yardopts&lt;/code&gt; file. What that file does isn&amp;rsquo;t important, but the task description is. The code inside that task block is fairly idiomatic Ruby code to write a list of things out to a file. And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is the secret. Rake leverages my understanding of Ruby to make working with Rake easier. Additionally, Rake leverages the entire Ruby standard library and, potentially, the entire library of Ruby Gems to make itself more powerful (more on Gems in a bit). These are the advantages that every Ruby DSL has right out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So not only does a Ruby DSL not have to worry about writing a grammar, a lexer, a parser, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about whether or not comments are needed in this language and how they are written&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but most importantly it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about all the weird things people might try to do with it. All the edge cases that are so hard to plan for in DSLs are covered because the DSL &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Ruby code. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to encode a way for my DSL to write to a file because Ruby has that capability. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to build in a way for my DSL to retrieve a file from a URL because Ruby has that already. Someone could use my DSL to send email and I&amp;rsquo;ll never know because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to think of it first! This is probably why DSLs are so common in Ruby, simply because they are so darned simple to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Diamond in the Rough No Longer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN&quot;&gt;CPAN&lt;/a&gt; did for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl&quot;&gt;Perl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems&quot;&gt;RubyGems&lt;/a&gt; has perfected. Both tools allow one to access a gigantic library of downloadable packages of code. Both tools allowed a simple command to install a package. To install a gem named &amp;ldquo;foo&amp;rdquo; I simply type &lt;code&gt;gem install foo&lt;/code&gt; and the RubyGems tool goes to the standard repository, retrieves foo and installs it for me in seconds. What RubyGems did though was add dependency management to the mix. Not only can I specify that my project is dependent on the foo gem, but I can state that my project requires specifically the 1.1.2 version of the foo gem. And if the 1.1.2 version of the foo gem depends on the 3.5.4 version of the bar gem, then the RubyGems system installs that too. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcskckuosxQ&quot;&gt;And so on, and so on &amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this writing there are 3,535 gems available. A gem could be a library of code to use in your own project&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or it could be a tool (like Rake) to make building your project easier, or it could be a stand-alone application&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is a simple idea, but a very complicated system to build, and even harder is building the community around the system that is necessary to make it successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in what I tend to think of as &amp;ldquo;the good old days&amp;rdquo; of programming, the 1970s, when people thought of a programming language, they thought of the language itself. They thought of the keywords, the language constructs, syntax and semantics. Everything else was an adjunct. Pascal was Pascal and Basic was Basic. On the other hand, you might have Turbo Pascal or Microsoft Basic, that generally came with a set of tools and maybe even frameworks or libraries to make working with Pascal or Basic easier and more productive, but nobody mistook that these were actual parts of the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the 80s and C became popular. Not only was C a new programming language but it also had, inseparably, a &amp;ldquo;standard library&amp;rdquo;. This allowed people to do more with C right out of the box and certainly had something to do with the language&amp;rsquo;s popularity. Nowadays all new programming languages come with a standard library, and what kinds of things show up in the standard library of a language is becoming more and more expansive. For example, compare the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library&quot;&gt;C standard library&lt;/a&gt; and its meager offerings of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math.h#Overview_of_functions&quot;&gt;math functions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdio.h&quot;&gt;I/O routines&lt;/a&gt; with even &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Class_Library&quot;&gt;Java&amp;rsquo;s Class Library&lt;/a&gt; that has things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Window_Toolkit&quot;&gt;2D graphics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;SQL database access&lt;/a&gt;, not to mention even more modern languages like Ruby and its &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubydoc.info/stdlib/optparse/frames&quot;&gt;standardized command-line option parsing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing that all new programming languages must offer if they wish to be competitive with the most successful languages is RubyGems-like package and dependency management. Go does have a package system with some basic dependency management, but it is nowhere near as mature as RubyGems is nor does it have the infrastructure that RubyGems does, i.e. one place to go to find the canonical list of packages that are available. Still, Go will definitely be a language to watch in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Documentation is a Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Best Friend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in order to be able to truly employ these gigantic and ever-expanding libraries of code, one needs quality documentation. This is possibly why most early languages were championed by corporations, because only corporations had the resources to really offer readable, complete, and consistently-updated documentation. But thanks to the creators of &lt;a href=&quot;http://yardoc.org/&quot;&gt;YARD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubydoc.info&quot;&gt;RubyDoc.info&lt;/a&gt; site, Ruby itself and virtually every Gem ever created has decent, if not good or great, documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YARD builds on the convention of GNU &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README&quot;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; files and the ideas in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc&quot;&gt;JavaDoc&lt;/a&gt;, to make writing documentation for one&amp;rsquo;s code simple and easy. YARD takes the README files that one is probably writing anyway along with quick-and-dirty code annotations and generates very readable, navigable and understandable HTML documentation that one can use locally, offer to users on one&amp;rsquo;s own website or if your code is offered as a Gem or on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, simply let RubyDoc.info serve your documentation. Even better, if you don&amp;rsquo;t like YARD&amp;rsquo;s default JavaDoc-inspired annotation system, YARD allows plugins to define your own&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Did I Say Documentation? I Meant Tests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests and testing is something that is near and dear to me, having spent the last several years as a professional developer building automated test systems and frameworks for commercial applications. Software systems are getting complicated enough that automated testing is the only truly scalable way to reduce the costs of bugs and allow programmers to concentrate on what they do best and &lt;a href=&quot;http://anndar.net/post/4136866534/programming-motherfucker&quot;&gt;what they are most passionate about&lt;/a&gt;, writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby has a large number of well-developed, mature and well-maintained automated test frameworks&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn5&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Not only that, but Ruby has test tools to make writing good tests easier such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md&quot;&gt;FactoryGirl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn6&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for quickly and easily defining test data as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/mocking&quot;&gt;plethora of libraries&lt;/a&gt; for creating &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/346372/whats-the-difference-between-faking-mocking-and-stubbing&quot;&gt;Mocks, Stubs and Fakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these frameworks and tools wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be springing up like weeds if the Ruby community and the general Ruby culture didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; automated testing. And this is one of the things that intrigued me initially about the Ruby community itself. You see, coming from a .NET background where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nunit.org/&quot;&gt;NUnit&lt;/a&gt; and related tools were well known but sadly not often used, to come over to a community where it seems every single chunk of code that is destined for public consumption has at the very least a modicum of tests packaged with it was like finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado&quot;&gt;El Dorado&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sweet Dreams Are Made of These&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been asking me a lot lately why I like Ruby so much. And mostly the things I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling them are the superficial things that excite me about the language itself, things like blocks, closures, the compact but not terse&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn7&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; syntax, the features and ideas it takes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming&quot;&gt;functional programming&lt;/a&gt; and the metaprogramming that makes writing code in Ruby both simpler and more complicated at the same time. But excitement wears off and familiarity breeds, if not contempt, then at least indifference. The things I&amp;rsquo;ve listed above are the things that are going to keep me coming back to Ruby, keep me writing Ruby code and keep me engaged in the Ruby community long after my ADD mentality has chased off after some new &amp;ldquo;ooo shiny!&amp;rdquo; These are also the things I will expect the next &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; language to provide before I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy about switching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do I use C-style &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; comments or Shell-style &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; comments?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://treetop.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;Treetop&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; that I use to build this site currently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomdoc.org/&quot;&gt;TomDoc&lt;/a&gt; has gathered a decent-sized following lately and, of course, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyworks.github.io/yard-tomdoc/&quot;&gt;YARD plugin for TomDoc&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rspec.info/&quot;&gt;RSpec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.seattlerb.org/minitest/&quot;&gt;Minitest&lt;/a&gt; being two of the most popular. Also both examples of Ruby DSLs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref5&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Ruby DSL.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref6&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn7&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terse in the sense of Perl&amp;rsquo;s line-noise-like syntax. From the book &amp;ldquo;Learning Perl&amp;rdquo;, one of the most popular books on the language:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref7&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, sometimes Perl looks like line noise to the uninitiated, but to the seasoned Perl programmer, it looks like checksummed line noise with a mission in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>This Blog Has Moved</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/02/this-blog-has-moved/"/>
   <updated>2013-05-02T18:39:54-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/05/02/this-blog-has-moved</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided that I wanted to have a little more control over, well, everything to do with this blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on this kick lately as things have moved to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing&quot;&gt;The Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, as everything has become more networked, and perhaps even having gotten a bit older where I want to know that the stuff I do now I will still have access to ten or twenty years from now. If there is one thing I have learned in the last ten years, it is that storage is cheap and I never have to throw data away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I have learned, though, is that everything changes. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many, many companies come and go. And many more rise and fall, even if they do not disappear completely. I&amp;rsquo;ve had something like ten to fifteen email addresses (not counting employer email addresses) since email was a thing and still keep five of them just in case someone from way back wants to get a hold of me. And I&amp;rsquo;m tired of losing my data, even if it is just photos I never look at or old emails from people I&amp;rsquo;ve lost touch with. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to lose any more data because I have switched providers and it is a pain to export my stuff. Google is doing something right with their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/takeout/&quot;&gt;Google Takeout&lt;/a&gt; program, but I was looking not just for the ability to export my data, but to have power over the format in which it is stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with computers way back in the 70s. (Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m old.) Do you know how many word processing file formats I&amp;rsquo;ve used? Let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can count them &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atari Word Processor&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LetterPerfect (on the Atari)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordStar (on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M&quot;&gt;CP/M&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordStar (on IBM PC)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordPerfect 4.2, 5.0 and 5.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WordPerfect for Windows 5.1 and 5.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word (probably every version ever made for the PC from the late 90s until a year or so ago)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of graphics formats, audio formats and video formats are probably almost this large each. If I still had one of those old word processing files and could somehow read the disk it was stored on, assuming the disk hadn&amp;rsquo;t demagnetized itself in the intervening decades, I could &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; get the text out of it, but definitely not the formatting. But trying to decode an image file that preceded GIF or TIFF? Or trying to decode an audio format that preceded MP3 or WAV? Probably not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything stored as raw text though? Not a problem. The reason why students of video game history can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jmechner/Prince-of-Persia-Apple-II&quot;&gt;source code to Prince of Persia&lt;/a&gt;, a video game that is about 25 years old, is because programming code is written as plain text. So the best way to store files that you want to &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; is to store them as simply as possible, because plain text isn&amp;rsquo;t going away.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve exported all of my blog entries out of Blogger and into plain text files that I can process with a set of tools to turn that plain text into my fancy new blog! All the metadata for each blog entry is stored in the text file itself. And the set of tools that I&amp;rsquo;m using can generate a blog that will work with &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; web hosting provider I might choose. It is completely customizable and gives me complete control over my data &amp;hellip; so I don&amp;rsquo;t lose anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if my thoughts are important enough for me to take the time to write them down &amp;hellip; then they&amp;rsquo;re important enough to save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing I remember most about this program was that each file held only a &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt; of data and there was some sort of index file that kept track of how many pages were in the document.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the reduced-functionality version of WordPerfect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if the file formats were compatible. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember that the disk formats weren&amp;rsquo;t compatible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref3&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that even &amp;ldquo;plain text&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as plain as I make it out to be with ASCII code pages and Unicode and such, but it is still a far cry better than some binary format whose definition and documentation is lost to history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref4&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Abusive Relationship That Is the American Cable Industry</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/02/02/the-abusive-relationship-that-is-the-american-cable-industry/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-02T12:04:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2013/02/02/the-abusive-relationship-that-is-the-american-cable-industry</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just got done reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/2026550/i-fought-the-cord-and-the-cord-won.html&quot;&gt;I Fought the Cord and the Cord Won&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/&quot;&gt;MacWorld&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a well-written article that examines one man&amp;rsquo;s attempt to divest his family of cable television and to use Internet-based alternatives, an option that is becoming increasingly more attractive for many and one that I have been using happily for several months now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been somehow distrustful of any commercial relationship that is based upon negotiation or haggling.  I&amp;rsquo;m certain this is naïve of me, to be honest, because the larger a transaction is, the more likely it is to require haggling: purchasing a house, a car or even negotiating your salary at a job, for example.  But for smaller purchases, the merchant should simply state what they consider a fair price and then it is up to me whether I want to pay it or not.  It makes me more comfortable to deal this way because then I feel that the merchant is treating me equitably and helps me trust them more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when someone tells me a price and then when I say no and begin to walk away they tell me a new, lower price, I feel like they were trying to cheat me.  I feel as if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol09wUI21lc&quot;&gt;original price wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fair one&lt;/a&gt;, but a price that they were quoting me to see if I was a sucker, a mark, a chump.  And so now, how can I trust that the new price is truly any more fair or just another step along the way to see &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; of a sucker I am?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, this is how the American cable industry constantly does business with their special offers to get you to switch providers and their deals to get you to stay, but that always have an expiration date.  Not to mention the bundles and the packages, always trying to maximize the amount of money they get out of you each month.  How many times have you come away from one of these negotiations and known exactly what your monthly bill was going to be?  And how many times have you been correct?  For me the answers are &amp;ldquo;almost never&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;not one single time&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, with the exception of the Internet service (that I desperately wish there was an alternative to, though where I live there are at least two choices), I cancelled my subscriptions from the cable company in favor of services such as Netflix, iTunes and Amazon Instant Video that tell me what they&amp;rsquo;re going to charge me &amp;hellip; and charge me exactly and only that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything else is just someone trying to put one over on you &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Planetside 2</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/11/20/planetside-2/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-20T21:06:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/11/20/planetside-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again, I am reminded why I do not play Sony games.  Planetside 2 is full of bugs.  How do I loath thee?  Let me count the ways &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use a Dvorak keyboard layout.  This makes keyboard remapping a complete necessity.  Which they do offer.  But I have to remap even the most basic movement keys for being on foot, in a land vehicle and in an air vehicle.  How about we just make movement a global setting?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constant crashes.  I only play for about half an hour before the client locks up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many cases where Vanu Sovereignty purple and New Conglomerate blue are pretty much indistinguishable &amp;hellip; cases in combat where milliseconds count.  And I&amp;rsquo;m not even color blind!  My best friend, Punish, he&amp;rsquo;s color blind in such a way that makes it hard to see the red in colors &amp;hellip; like distinguishing purple from blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics glitches.  I had to experiment with the graphics settings for about half an hour before I could get some settings that actually worked.  It turned out that I needed to set the basic &amp;ldquo;Graphics Quality&amp;rdquo; setting (that has no description tooltip) to Low.  Everything else I can set as high as I like.  From what I can tell, this forces the client to use the low-quality models.  If I set the graphics quality setting to anything else, even Medium, I get strange artifacts where polygons aren&amp;rsquo;t erased and everyone has crazy-ass googly eyes &amp;hellip; (it appears the eyeballs are drawn on the outside of the head).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am soooooo glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay for this piece of crap.  Oh, and the most hilarious part &amp;hellip; in one of those frequent crashes I noticed something.  When I went to Task Manager to kill the locked up client &amp;hellip; it had the version number in the description: v0.470xxx.  It&amp;rsquo;s not even version 1!  They knew they were shipping crap.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Another Potential Boon to Wargaming - Kickstarter</title>

   <updated>2012-04-15T07:34:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/04/15/another-potential-boon-to-wargaming-kickstarter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; yet, you should take the time to check it out soon.  Kickstarter is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing&quot;&gt;crowd-sourced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor&quot;&gt;angel investorish&lt;/a&gt; system that anyone can get in on.  The idea is that if you have a project or product or something that you want to launch but don&amp;rsquo;t have the money for, you post the idea on Kickstarter and ask if people want to invest in your idea.  You give a goal of a certain amount of money by a certain date and if enough people invest in your idea to where you reach the goal in the time allotted, your project gets funded.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great system that has funded a lot of cool new businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I think it could be a boon to wargaming is that a little company calling itself &lt;a href=&quot;http://tectoniccraftstudios.com/&quot;&gt;Tectonic Craft Studios&lt;/a&gt; has already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101466427/tectonic-craft-studios-new-line-of-war-games-terra&quot;&gt;used Kickstarter to fund its idea&lt;/a&gt; of making a new line of wargaming terrain.  All they asked for was eight thousand US dollars, but the Kickstarter community put together over $40,000 for them!  I hope that they are able to take this start and make a great business out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What other ideas are out there in the wargaming community where the creativity and the initiative has always been there &amp;hellip; but the money to get started has never materialized?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tribes: Ascend</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/04/13/tribes-ascend/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-13T14:58:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/04/13/tribes-ascend</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new entry in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_%28series%29&quot;&gt;Tribes saga&lt;/a&gt; came out yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://account.hirezstudios.com/tribesascend/default.aspx?ok=&quot;&gt;Tribes: Ascend&lt;/a&gt; &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;293&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/O-70Bg2zRsg&quot; width=&quot;520&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you may not know about me is that I was a big &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_2&quot;&gt;Tribes 2&lt;/a&gt; fan back in the day.  It is the one first-person shooter (FPS) game that held my interest for any length of time and the only one where I actually enjoyed playing against other human players.  I was even a member of a ranked team on the Tribes 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_table&quot;&gt;ladder&lt;/a&gt; at the time.  What made Tribes different from all the other FPS games out there?  I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strategy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of FPS games, then and now, have no strategy to them.  Each person playing the game is just an interchangeable and disposable cog with nothing to differentiate them, nothing to encourage or support alternate play styles other than &amp;ldquo;run up to the other guy and shoot them in the face until they fall down&amp;rdquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the philosophy of sword fighting explained in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120746/&quot;&gt;The Mask of Zorro&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;The pointy end goes into the other man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Tribes 2 (and noted exception to the above &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Fortress&quot;&gt;Team Fortress&lt;/a&gt;) highlighted only one game mode, Capture the Flag.  There were others, but the real way to play Tribes 2 was to play Capture the Flag.  This introduced some strategy, yes &amp;hellip; but where it really shined was the fact that the maps you played on featured bases with defenses, sensors and generators to power it all.  So you could actually build up your base&amp;rsquo;s defenses to make it harder for the other team to get to your flag.  Or they could sneak in and take out your generator to make all your automated defenses come down.  So you had players that became good at different roles, like generator defense, defense setup and maintenance, flag defense, flag capture or flag runner.  (Yes, capturing and running were generally two different roles, at least in my clan.)  I actually was very good at defense setup and generator defense.  I studied the maps for the best places to plant my turrets, my mines and then stand in heavy armor to wait for the inevitable sneaker to try to get through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Tribes did was give the player some choices and a game with a captivating amount of depth was created.  One could play offense, defense or &amp;ldquo;transportation&amp;rdquo; (some of the maps in Tribes 2 were so huge that you needed vehicles to cross them with anything that would be described as rapidity).  One could wear light but fast armor, heavy but slow armor or split the difference with the medium armor.  One never even needed to take a shot at another player, going only for the support route by running around the base and repairing things that the other team broke.  (I particularly liked this role &amp;hellip; it was my own, personal type of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Griefing&quot;&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten deep enough into Tribes: Ascend in order to determine if it will hold up to my memories of Tribes gone by &amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting my thoughts here!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>das Keyboard for Mac</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/04/06/das-keyboard-for-mac/"/>
   <updated>2012-04-06T09:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/04/06/das-keyboard-for-mac</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been touch-typing for a long, long time.  I originally taught myself to touch-type on my dad&amp;rsquo;s old manual typewriter from college.  I remember a time when pretty much all keyboards were metal and seemingly constructed to withstand a nuclear blast.  I&amp;rsquo;ve always been pretty picky about the keyboards that I use, even going to the extent of learning the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard&quot;&gt;Dvorak keyboard layout&lt;/a&gt;.  But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that I really started pining for the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard&quot;&gt;mechanical-switch-style keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that have come into vogue.  I like the clicky-clack of the old keyboards &amp;hellip; and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until people started pointing out that old keyboards truly were different that I took a look around and decided to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually settled on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daskeyboard.com&quot;&gt;das Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;.  Partially it was because of the attention to detail.  Originally they touted that the various keys were loaded with different resistances depending on how strong the finger was that was intended to operate it.  Partially it is because I could get the same keyboard in loud or quiet form.  But eventually, it was because it was one of the few mechanical keyboards that offered a Mac model that said it would work with the various Mac function keys like volume and brightness control, etc.  Also, they offered a key puller to let you rearrange the keys so that those of us who use a Dvorak layout could actually have the keycaps displaying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my new das Keyboard for Mac yesterday and have been playing around with it for a bit.  I immediately pulled all the keycaps off and reorganized them.  Despite seemingly encouraging exactly this practice, it seems the keyboard isn&amp;rsquo;t designed to pull the caps off and rearrange them, just clean under them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/IMG_0275.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;das Keyboard for Mac&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to see that the &amp;ldquo;?&amp;rdquo; key and the &amp;ldquo;-&amp;rdquo; key are a little out of plumb.  What&amp;rsquo;s less obvious is that the bracket keys are a little shorter than their horizontal neighbors.  None of this has affected my typing so far or irritated me, but it was one use case that I thought I would have and don&amp;rsquo;t seem to.  Had I known, I&amp;rsquo;d have thought more about getting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/&quot;&gt;blank keycap version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, the keyboard is &lt;strong&gt;solid&lt;/strong&gt;.  It is heavy and feels like it could withstand a nuclear blast &amp;hellip; except all the plastic keycaps would melt.  But it feels like the innards would be fine.  And it feels like it will last a long, long time.  We&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait and see on that count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being heavy and solid, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bulky.  The desktop footprint is only a little larger than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB110LL/B/apple-keyboard-with-numeric-keypad-english-usa&quot;&gt;Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad&lt;/a&gt; that I had been using previously.  It also has two USB ports in it, like the Apple keyboard.  Unlike the Apple keyboard, they are full power so they can charge an iPhone.  The das Keyboard manages this by having one USB cable with two plugs.  One for the keyboard and one for power for the hub.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t need to charge things with the USB ports on the keyboard, then you only have to plug in one of the connectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty satisfied with the new keyboard and its ultra-clicky sound &amp;hellip; just like I remember it.  We&amp;rsquo;ll just have to wait and see if it stands the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Personalized Search</title>

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/04/03/personalized-search</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a great idea for a search engine to implement.  I have multiple tools at my disposal for trying to remember stuff that is on the Internet.  I can make a bookmark in my web browser.  I can use a tool like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instapaper.com&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt;.  For programming, I can make a question and answer on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.  But these are all a bunch of data silos.  I can&amp;rsquo;t readily search across all of them.  And if I forget where I read that one article &amp;hellip; did I archive it on Instapaper?  Did I drop it into Evernote?  I have a solution &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the search engines to provide a way for me to mark something as of &amp;ldquo;personal interest&amp;rdquo; to me.  Then when I search for something, it will rank my personal interest items alongside everything else, but give my personal interest items a boost in the rankings.  Or maybe just list them off to the side in a kind of, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I noticed you&amp;rsquo;re searching for information on Git, it looks like you have a guide to Git bookmarked and it looks like it has the information you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have to sign up for an account with the search engine of my choice for this to work, because I would want my &amp;ldquo;personal interest&amp;rdquo; items available no matter which machine I was logged into.  But, for this feature, I would gladly do so.  I would also like this to be an API that any service across the Internet could use.  So Evernote could submit my notes to the API.  Instapaper could submit my articles to the API.  Perhaps it could even boost the accuracy of the ranking systems the algorithmic search engines use because it would be another source of data separate from links between web pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway &amp;hellip; Google?  Bing?  Either of you listening?  Whichever one implements this to my satisfaction first wins my business.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Greedy Fat Cats</title>

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/01/30/greedy-fat-cats</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long-time reader of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.penny-arcade.com&quot;&gt;Penny Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and even been an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcer&quot;&gt;Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://paxsite.com&quot;&gt;PAX&lt;/a&gt; for the first six years of its existence.  I have a ton of respect for the folks behind Penny Arcade including Mike Krahulik, Jerry Holkins and Robert Khoo among others.  Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cwgabriel/status/164146574606340096&quot;&gt;Mike tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; Gamestop is a greedy fat cat that didn&amp;rsquo;t do shit.&amp;rdquo;  I have very specifically taken this quote out of context because I find the comment itself interesting as an indication just how much the Internet has changed things in our world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, the supply chain behind bringing a good (as opposed to a service) to market was pretty much assumed to be: manufacturer, distributor/wholesaler, retailer and customer.  Each step in the chain provided some benefit to the customer.  The manufacturer created the good.  The distributor or wholesaler was good at getting a certain class of goods from various manufacturers to tons of locations around the country or the world.  The retailer provided a clean, stable, safe and (sometimes) knowledgeable environment from which you could inspect, sample and purchase the good.  I would not have known about a great many computer games in my youth had my local &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egghead_Software&quot;&gt;Egghead Software&lt;/a&gt; not stocked them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The role of the retailer has certainly changed significantly in the last few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyZxzkd-Jsk&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;3D printing scene&lt;/a&gt; for a little while, thinking that I&amp;rsquo;d really like to get my hands on one of those and do something really cool with it.  3D printers like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.makerbot.com/3d-printers.html&quot;&gt;MakerBot Thing-O-Matic&lt;/a&gt; have the potential to be the beginning of something really special, I believe.  It&amp;rsquo;s one of those ideas that I can&amp;rsquo;t yet conceive of how it will revolutionize things, but I believe it will.  Perhaps this is how my parents felt when my dad was working with computers in the 1970s and thought that we should have a computer at home because they knew that it was going to be the future.  But I digress &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a &amp;ldquo;reduce all the things&amp;rdquo; binge around the house because I&amp;rsquo;m at the point in my life where I want things simple.  The problem here is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been a good American consumer and bought a &lt;strong&gt;metric crapton&lt;/strong&gt; of crap!  (I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a new state of George Carlin&amp;rsquo;s classic stuff/crap dichotomy: When you no longer want the stuff you have, it becomes crap.)  I want to organize my house and one of the easiest ways to organize things is to reduce the number of things that need organizing by getting rid of the things you don&amp;rsquo;t really need but are afraid to throw away.  Getting a 3D printer (one more thing) that will allow me to make things on demand (probably a whole bunch of things) is &amp;hellip; shall we say &amp;hellip; somewhat counterproductive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to resist the temptation to purchase one of these wonderful contraptions, so far.  But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I haven&amp;rsquo;t been thinking about what I could do with one of them, if I were to purchase one.  And then I saw on Twitter that someone had made a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hirmes/status/160900821435944960&quot;&gt;3D terrain map of the Hudson Valley&lt;/a&gt; using a MakerBot.  Then it hit me, what if game clubs or game stores purchased MakerBots and started printing their own miniatures, terrain and so forth?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are a couple ways to obtain or create miniatures suitable for wargaming.  One can purchase off-the-rack mass-produced miniatures.  Or one can create one-off or even small run miniatures using a resin casting method.  Resin casting generally provides lower-quality miniatures than mass produced ones, but are generally cheaper than their mass produced counterparts.  I would expect 3D printed miniatures to be more expensive than resin cast and possibly mass produced miniatures, but to have quality rivaling or even exceeding in some cases the mass produced miniatures.  The exact differences in cost and quality would require more research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But think of the convenience!  What if I were a sculptor with some talent for creating miniatures models?  Or a 3D artist?  Perhaps I could sell designs that people with 3D printers could use to create their miniatures with?  Perhaps deals could be struck between the artist and game stores where the artist gets a percentage of every miniature printed by the game store?  Perhaps new miniature wargaming companies could sell designs with their rule sets so people could print the miniatures at home or take them into the game store to be printed for a modest sum over cost of materials?  And just think, for the people for whom the painting of the army is ninety percent of the fun of having a huge miniature army &amp;hellip; an endless supply of things to paint!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind boggles!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Trials and Tribulations with My New iMac</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/01/20/trials-and-tribulations-with-my-new-imac/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-20T08:29:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2012/01/20/trials-and-tribulations-with-my-new-imac</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/imac&quot;&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt;, making my conversion to The Dark Side complete. I got it almost completely tricked out. I was especially glad to get the SSD/HD combination. It&amp;rsquo;s a 240GB SSD for the system drive and then a 1TB HD for whatever. The problem is that the way the system comes configured from the factory you would end up just using the SSD for everything unless you do some wizardry first. So I had to go and teach myself the wizardry through a couple failed attempts before I landed on what I believe, now, to be the proper solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Form 1: Default Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default configuration from the factory makes the SSD the main drive where everything gets stored.  The system, all the applications, all the user folders, everything.  The problems with this configuration are that I have a 1TB drive that is now useless and the SSD is only 240GB.  This is big enough for a while and may even be big enough if I wanted to really watch my disk usage.  But the whole point is that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to watch my disk usage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Form 2: Move /Users to HD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more like it!  So now I have the operating system, applications and such on the super-fast (but small) SSD and all my big fat user files like pictures and music and videos on the HD.  This is how I did it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Users directory on the HD (named &amp;ldquo;Macintosh HD 2&amp;rdquo; by default).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the contents of &lt;code&gt;/Users&lt;/code&gt; to the new Users directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open System Preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Users &amp;amp; Groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the lower-left corner, click the lock to unlock and make changes.  (Authenticating as an administrator also, if necessary.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click on a user and select &amp;ldquo;Advanced Options&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where it says &amp;ldquo;Home Directory&amp;rdquo; click the Choose button and select the new directory in the new Users folder.  (This would be &lt;code&gt;/Volumes/Macintosh HD 2/Users/[username]&lt;/code&gt; if everything is still on its defaults.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Ok and repeat for the other users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I ran into with this configuration is that some stuff I use at the command line chokes on a home directory path that has spaces in it.  This led me to &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Form 3: Delete /Users and Create a Link&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the link does for you is that anything that looks for &lt;code&gt;/Users/Foo&lt;/code&gt; gets sent to &lt;code&gt;/Volumes/Macintosh HD 2/Users/Foo&lt;/code&gt; instead.  But it is all behind the scenes and isn&amp;rsquo;t the wiser &amp;hellip; so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to choke on the spaces in the path.  This is how I did it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete &lt;code&gt;/Users&lt;/code&gt;.  (Not a big deal because everything was already pointing to the other drive.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the command: &lt;code&gt;sudo ln -s /Users /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD\ 2/Users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about this is now &lt;code&gt;/Users and /Volumes/Macintosh HD 2/Users&lt;/code&gt; were essentially indistinguishable.  But then I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.com/article/1164891/keeping_mac_os_and_data_on_separate_drives.html&quot;&gt;this article from MacWorld&lt;/a&gt; and learned of a weakness in my plan &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Form 4: Abandon the Link and Go Back to Form 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with this plan is exposed in the final paragraph of the article.  (Good thing I read the whole thing!)  What happens if at some point the HD dies?  The system could still boot because the SSD is working, but it can&amp;rsquo;t because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a way to log in as any valid user!  But how do I take the advice and still keep my command line stuff from choking on spaces?  Rename the drives!  I renamed &amp;ldquo;Macintosh HD&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;System&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Macintosh HD 2&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo;.  Then I had to delete the link and recreate the /Users directory.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Terminal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the command: &lt;code&gt;sudo rm /Users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type the command: &lt;code&gt;sudo mkdir /Users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I went in and created a new administrator user called &lt;code&gt;backupadmin&lt;/code&gt; and left their home directory in the default &lt;code&gt;/Users&lt;/code&gt; location.  Any other real users I create will have to be migrated to the HD by hand, but I think this will work best in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some Thoughts on Application Stores and Openness</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/12/24/some-thoughts-on-application-stores-and-openness/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-24T13:15:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/12/24/some-thoughts-on-application-stores-and-openness</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In writing down my thoughts on why I switched to Mac from PC, I ended up composing a big rant on the difference between the iOS App Store and the Android App Store from what I hope is a rational cost/benefit perspective.  I wanted to post these thoughts separately to protect the flow of that other article and also because I think it is deserving of its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to divorce this analysis as much as possible from the iOS App Store and the Android App Store.  So I will generically refer to a few different things.  There is the application store.  This is the store, virtual or physical, from which applications are purchased in order to be installed upon a device.  There is the user.  This is the person or party who owns the device on which applications will be installed and used.  There is the operator.  This is the person or party who owns, operates and optionally curates the application store.  Curation is the action of managing what is contained and ultimately sold from the application store.  When I speak of curation, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of the kind that we see in the Apple application stores.  I know that the Android application store does remove applications and perhaps even proactively prevents some applications from being listed, but these are rather rare exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who benefits from keeping bad apps out of an application store?  The user does surely because they can purchase apps without fear.  Does the operator benefit?  They might sell a few more applications because of the benefit enjoyed by users, but they also might not.  Curation, on the other hand, is a huge cost.  Each application and every update must be scrutinized by, presumably, both automated and manual processes.  So the operator of a curated application store must spend a lot of resources for a benefit enjoyed mostly by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who benefits from fewer apps in an application store?  The user benefits if the apps that are allowed in are of the same variety, similar cost and of generally higher quality.  The operator benefits if the apps that are allowed in somehow bring in more revenue than all apps would.  Again, curation is not free.  So, once again, the operator of a curated application store is spending a lot of resources for a benefit enjoyed mostly if not solely by the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who benefits from an application store that will allow any application with as few restrictions as possible?  The user is taking the risk of downloading malicious applications.  The user has to judge quality for themselves using their own time and money.  The user has to be their own curator.  The operator of the application store benefits from allowing in all applications because they have an application store without the cost of curation.  The operator benefits because users and volunteers like security researchers will find the bad apps and notify the operator who can then take corrective action reactively.  In this scenario, the operator benefits from the users&amp;rsquo; and volunteers&amp;rsquo; efforts, does not incur the overhead of curation and possibly brings in more revenue because all apps has a chance of making more money than most apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the costs of curation is that good apps can be thought bad and not allowed in to an application store.  Or the operator can use curation as an excuse for barring good applications from the application store that might cost the operator something.  These can cost the user the enjoyment or benefit of the good app.  Mistakes and maliciousness, from the perspective of the user, are the costs of curation.  These can be minimized, if the operator is interested, but perhaps not eliminated.  (Maliciousness doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be systemic, it could be that an app reviewer sees that their old college nemesis submitted an app and rejects it to &amp;ldquo;get back at them.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it looks to me like the majority of the costs of the curated approach are borne by the operator and the majority of the benefits are enjoyed by the user.  The reverse seems to be true of the uncurated application store.  Looking at it from this perspective, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to have a new respect for the Apple approach to the application store.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Words to Live By</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A story I heard somewhere &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vegetarian friend of mine told me that I&amp;rsquo;m not &amp;ldquo;evolved&amp;rdquo; because I eat meat.  He said people only started eating cows thousands of years ago because they were savages, they were barbarians and they didn&amp;rsquo;t know any better.  People who eat cows now are not evolved.  What a bunch of bullshit.  People ate cows thousands of years ago for the same reason we eat cows today.  Because they are easy to catch.  We&amp;rsquo;re not savages, we&amp;rsquo;re just lazy.  A cheetah could taste like chocolate heroin, we&amp;rsquo;ll never know.  Those little bastards are fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of &amp;ldquo;tasting like chocolate heroin&amp;rdquo; and look for ways to work the phrase into casual conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We Don't Need No Steenkin' Cable!</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/10/16/we-dont-need-no-steenkin-cable/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-16T13:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/10/16/we-dont-need-no-steenkin-cable</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in March, I wrote a post about &lt;a href=&quot;/2011/03/27/the-ultimate-set-top-box.html&quot;&gt;The Ultimate Set-Top Box&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about it lately and the fact that I just don&amp;rsquo;t watch much cable TV anymore.  Sure, when I&amp;rsquo;m bored I occasionally flip through the things on my TiVo, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any huge hardship to choose something else like reading a book, playing a video game or working on a programming hobby project.  So the question is &amp;hellip; how much extra am I spending on a cable subscription that I don&amp;rsquo;t need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some research.  Actually, I did some digging because Frontier Communications made it very hard to find out this information.  I tried going through their website via my account to see if I could change my plan.  They would not allow me to deselect TV from my current plan.  I could add or upgrade services, but I could not remove anything.  I finally had to resort to logging into their website as a new customer and look up the currently available plans that way.  Still, they didn&amp;rsquo;t make it easy because of the dizzying array of choices available.  But I was able to finally select just FIOS Internet without TV, without Home Phone, at my current speed rating.  Making this change would save me $30 per month.  It also turns out that the next &lt;strong&gt;higher&lt;/strong&gt; speed rating might save me an additional $10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org&quot;&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt; recently pointed out in a podcast, $40 per month can buy a lot of TV or movies on iTunes (or Amazon or Hulu or [insert your favorite video service here]).  Approximately thirty dollars will buy you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005RK6EU8/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;redirect=true&quot;&gt;a full thirteen-episode season of Doctor Who in HD&lt;/a&gt; from Amazon Video-on-Demand.  A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043U5TEK/ref=atv_dp_season_select?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;redirect=true&quot;&gt;full season of House in HD&lt;/a&gt; will run you about $56.  iTunes runs slightly more at $37 and $60, respectively.  Remember, these are HD videos that are yours to keep (so long as the DRM continues to be supported) with no commercials or other claptrap getting in the way.  $40 per month is $480 per year or eight full American-style seasons in HD.  So I could still have the shows that I really do want to watch, in a format that may allow me more freedom to watch when, how and on which device I want to watch it, and possibly still save me money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just need to figure out how to break the news to my daughter &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Making Your Own Tools</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/10/16/making-your-own-tools/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-16T11:40:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/10/16/making-your-own-tools</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I remember reading somewhere that you aren&amp;rsquo;t a real carpenter until you&amp;rsquo;ve made your own tools.  Not being a carpenter of any sort, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if its true or not, but I&amp;rsquo;ve started to feel like it might be true for programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that IDEs are becoming required to work with code.  And more and more, these IDEs have very similar, but not the same, features.  They all offer customization of one form or another, but what&amp;rsquo;s more custom than something that works exactly the way you want it to, because you wrote it that way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve set out on a quest to take the journey of my programming forefathers and write, to begin with, an editor and a language with its own compiler/interpreter.  Perhaps the two will be related, perhaps not.  Perhaps the language will be generally useful or maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll only be the extension language for the editor &amp;hellip; or perhaps it will be nothing more than an experiment in language design and have no practical purpose whatsoever.  But I expect that once I get to a certain basic level of usefulness with the editor, it will become my sole text editor since I do believe in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one&amp;#x27;s_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;eating my own dogfood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my platform of choice nowadays is the Mac, I have already started writing my editor as an Objective-C OS X application.  I started out with the code from the article: &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/TextArchitecture/Tasks/TextEditor.html&quot;&gt;Building a Text Editor in 15 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;.  It has given me a huge appreciation for the underpinnings of OS X and gotten my editor almost all the way to that basic usability level I mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I move forward, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing thoughts and discoveries from my journey here.  I hope you find them useful &amp;hellip; or at least entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Taxes Kill Developer Passion</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/05/10/taxes-kill-developer-passion/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-10T23:22:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/05/10/taxes-kill-developer-passion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/process-kills-developer-passion.html&quot;&gt;Process Kills Developer Passion&lt;/a&gt; earlier today and could not wait to get home and write up my thoughts.  The essay posits that &amp;ldquo;Over the past few years, the software industry has become increasingly focused on process and metrics as a way to ensure &amp;lsquo;quality&amp;rsquo; code.&amp;rdquo;  On the contrary, the software industry as a whole has been tilting at that particular windmill for almost as long as there has been code.  The shift in focus is that now it is developers themselves that are trying to build systems to ensure quality code, not just managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lists a bunch of ways that one would be spending time on process rather than not-process, presumably getting real work done.  He also lists a few horror stories like &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; the test cases took two- or three-times as much time to code as the actual code &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.  My only question there was, &amp;ldquo;Were they good test cases?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that spending more time than is necessary on process can be seen as a tax, resources that are spent on things that do not benefit the end result of the project.  But in the cases of things that are objected to, they are not necessarily a tax.  Perhaps they were on the projects he has worked on.  But I have also seen counterexamples of the things that are listed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing full TDD, enabling the developers to write less actual code because the tests proved that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requiring a high percentage of code coverage, ensuring that the tests that were written don&amp;rsquo;t just test the same code over and over again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having full code-reviews on all checkins, giving newer developers a chance to learn from their more experienced colleagues &amp;hellip; and even their more experienced colleagues being exposed to new techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using tools to measure code complexity, so that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a bunch of time wasted in code reviews saying, &amp;ldquo;I think this is too complex&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the processes that the article decries can be useful (or at least some of them).  It is only when there is a bunch of wasted effort through mindless devotion to &amp;ldquo;the process&amp;rdquo; that something quickly becomes a tax.  And taxes kill developer passion because a developer gets their pleasure out of creating something.  The more taxes that are heaped on top of creating something, the less pleasure they feel.  The less pleasure, the less passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let us not forget the biggest tax of all, bad code.  Bad code forces one to do battle with it in order to make changes.  Bad code drags on a project so that it is moving slower and slower and slower until any change is moving the project backward because fixing one bug leads to the introduction of at least one new bug.  Bad code is a tax because the time spent fixing bad code could be spent moving the project forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a wise man once said, &amp;ldquo;The only things certain in life are death and taxes.&amp;rdquo;  You are going to pay taxes on your project, whether it is in the form of process to prevent bad code from entering your code base or in the form of fixing the bad code once it got in there.  Does that mean we should just suck it up and accept the drudgery of process?  Hell no!  But there&amp;rsquo;s no reason process should be drudgery.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many code review tools out there that significantly speed up the code review process as well as make it a searchable system that can be mined for information and learnings.  (Malevich and Mondrian are two that spring to mind.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of time doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a chore.  The Evidence-Based Scheduling in FogBugz uses a very simple system.  When you start working on a work item, you click a little dropdown and say which one you&amp;rsquo;re working on.  When you stop, you set it to Nothing.  It even auto-stops for you at lunch and quitting time if you configure it so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning Poker and other practices have been developed to make planning easy, accurate and fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article points out that there is a spread of skill levels amongst developers and that it isn&amp;rsquo;t fair to force the best developers to submit to process that is designed to prevent the worst developers from making mistakes.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbetterhealth.com/why-doctors-should-be-less-like-chuck-yeager-and-more-like-captain-sullenberger/2010.11.24&quot;&gt;Checklists and following process&lt;/a&gt; have shown time and again that they reduce defects even amongst the most talented.  Because all developers make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just as we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t perceive mindless process as a magic bullet, neither should we perceive all process as evil.  Let&amp;rsquo;s just strive for more and more ways to keep the taxes down.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Evil That Is the Credit Industry</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/04/15/the-evil-that-is-the-credit-industry/"/>

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/04/15/the-evil-that-is-the-credit-industry</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my problems with credit.  I never got to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093908/&quot;&gt;Confessions of a Shopaholic&lt;/a&gt; level, but a long time ago I realized my limitations and simply cut myself off from the credit world.  I paid in cash or money orders for a couple years and then when debit cards came out I used them.  The last two cars I&amp;rsquo;ve owned were paid for in cash and there is almost nothing more liberating than knowing you don&amp;rsquo;t have that $200-500 per month payment that it seems all your friends have.  It was a good way to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if you want to buy a house before you retire &amp;hellip; you pretty much need credit.  And this is one of the areas where I think credit is a good use.  Unfortunately, to borrow that much money you need a credit rating and in order to have a decent credit rating, you have to have some credit.  So, I&amp;rsquo;ve delved back into the ugly world of credit by getting myself a secured credit card and just a couple weeks ago I got a credit card based on the modicum of credit I now have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When filling out the application for the newest credit card, I specifically stated that I did not want a cash advance PIN for it.  I have money in savings for emergencies if I truly need cash and really &amp;hellip; who doesn&amp;rsquo;t accept credit cards nowadays?  Loan sharks?  And have you read the cash advance terms on your credit card policies?  They&amp;rsquo;re always way, way worse than just buying something on credit.  (And the terms I have for my credit cards, because of my history, are already onerous.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did I get in the mail yesterday?  I got a cash advance PIN.  Y&amp;#39;know &amp;hellip; just in case I might need it, even though I checked the box that said I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it.  There were all these instructions on how to make sure it didn&amp;rsquo;t fall into the wrong hands, including destroying the letter that I held in my very own hands &amp;hellip; the ones that I didn&amp;rsquo;t trust with this kind of temptation &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I shredded it without looking at the number.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Ultimate Set Top Box</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/03/27/the-ultimate-set-top-box/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-27T11:04:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2011/03/27/the-ultimate-set-top-box</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I struck upon an idea the other night while talking to a friend on the phone.  Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if I could get rid of the series of boxes in my entertainment center?  Ok, perhaps getting rid of all of them is too much to ask, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think that reducing down to the TV and one &amp;ldquo;set-top&amp;rdquo; box is going too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I currently have the following in my entertainment center:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xbox 360 - for playing games and streaming Netflix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TiVo - for cable, DVR and Amazon video downloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sony PS/3 - almost exclusively for BluRay movie watching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think that the Xbox is really close to being my one and only box in my entertainment center.  Here is what it would take for this to happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CableCARD&quot;&gt;CableCARD&lt;/a&gt; support to the Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add DVR capability to the Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a BluRay drive to the Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Amazon Video-on-Demand support to the Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, my TiVo is my cable television set-top box because it supports CableCARD.  I just plugged in a card I rent from my cable company (for a cheaper amount than if I rented a digital set-top box) and my TiVo now controls my cable television.  True, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have some of the extra features that the cable company provides, but mostly that&amp;rsquo;s video on demand and DVR capabilities &amp;hellip; which my TiVo provides.  So if Microsoft puts a CableCARD slot and DVR software into the Xbox, then I can replace most of my TiVo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft puts a BluRay drive in the Xbox, then I can get rid of my PS/3 &amp;hellip; along with being able to store a bunch more data on my game discs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft adds Amazon Video-on-Demand support to the Xbox Live service, then I can get rid of the one remaining feature of my TiVo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; to be able to just use my Xbox as my sole entertainment hub.  It already does so much, from watching movies, to streaming video, to listening to music, to playing games.  And if they rolled the &amp;ldquo;guide subscription&amp;rdquo; that most DVR devices charge for access to channel listings and such into the Xbox Live annual service, then they might even boost Xbox Live subscription numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, please make this happen!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The March of Progress</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/09/27/the-march-of-progress/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-27T13:17:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/09/27/the-march-of-progress</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on my way home from a programming conference in Baltimore right now, typing this out on my new laptop.  At the same time, I&amp;rsquo;m downloading videos from Amazon Video on Demand to watch on the flight through the airport Internet access.  In my backpack, I have my Amazon Kindle with ninety-two books on it and hundreds of thousands more available with a couple of mouse clicks.  In my pocket, I have my smartphone that can access virtually any website in the world, run a plethora of helpful applications as well as the more mundane placing and receiving of calls or text messages.  The battery in the phone lasts all day almost no matter what I do with it.  The battery in my laptop, if I&amp;rsquo;m careful, will last about five hours of active use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a little over ten years ago I was flying to and from Taipei for work.  I had a few books with me, a laptop crammed full of music (video was too large to store more than a little bit on a computer) and one game that I had bought to bring with me so I would have something to do in the hotel room.  I carried a pager with me for text messages and a cell phone for calls, but I could only keep the cell phone on for a few hours at most even if all I did was just left it on &amp;hellip; so I gave out my pager number for people to get a hold of me and then called them back on the cell phone after turning it on.  The laptop battery lasted about five hours of listening to music and doing nothing else with the screen and everything else I could turned off on the plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hundred years ago, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been taking a plane at all.  What I can do in just a few hours now would have taken days on a train or weeks on a boat.  For most, it would have been a one-way trip to start a new life rather than something taken at a whim or for leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how quickly things are changing within my lifetime compared to the period before it.  I wonder what the next ten years will bring?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Files Are an Implementation Detail</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/08/08/files-are-an-implementation-detail/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-08T08:46:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/08/08/files-are-an-implementation-detail</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John C. Dvorak recently wrote that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2367202,00.asp&quot;&gt;the desktop gets no respect, and it should&lt;/a&gt;.  This column has been a source of discussion and disagreement between my friends since it made the rounds.  Leaving aside the whole &amp;ldquo;licensing&amp;rdquo; issue, what Mr. Dvorak nearly captures is the divide between what most people need to use computers for and what professionals need to use computers for.  He claims that the desktop can do things that appliances can&amp;rsquo;t.  I disagree, one only needs to look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo&quot;&gt;TiVo&lt;/a&gt; to see an example of an appliance that does things that one would once have needed a desktop computer to do or had to do manually.  But let me start by defining my terms &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/appliance&quot;&gt;appliance&lt;/a&gt;, for the purposes of our discussion, is a device that performs a task or set of related tasks in a way that a user can learn to operate it by intuition or usage and hides most if not all implementation details from the user.  A refrigerator is an appliance because you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know how it works in order to keep your food cold, you just open the door, stick something in and a few hours later it is cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A desktop computer is not an appliance because you need to learn aspects of how it operates in order to properly use it.  You need to know about files, folders, networks, programs and a whole lot more.  And the more the computer can do, the more you have to learn.  A desktop computer does not hide its implementation details.  As a matter of fact, its job is more to piece together various things that let you use the implementation details without hiding them.  Yes, you can plug in to a network nowadays without needing to know much about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp/ip&quot;&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt;, network protocols or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_stack&quot;&gt;OSI stack&lt;/a&gt;.  But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t keep that stuff from you either.  A refrigerator doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you access to its compressor and let you tweak it.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another point where I disagree with Mr. Dvorak.  The modern automobile &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an appliance.  I don&amp;rsquo;t need to know anything about how a car works in order to operate it.  I don&amp;rsquo;t need to know about the transmission, the engine, or the brakes.  I just need to know that putting the car in &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; and pushing the accelerator makes it go.  I take my car to a mechanic to fix it, just like I have a professional come and fix the refrigerator if its broken.  It is only the American love affair with the automobile that has kept it so the average person still can get access to the engine and other internals.  And while I know more than many about how an automobile works, I have only the most basic grasp of newer automotive technology like anti-lock brakes and traction control.  Those are things that I have decided I don&amp;rsquo;t need to understand, they just work.  That&amp;rsquo;s the magic of an appliance, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to know in order for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what I believe computers are and should be evolving into, the modern photo camera.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  You have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-and-shoot_camera&quot;&gt;point-and-shoot camera&lt;/a&gt; for consumers and you have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-lens_reflex_camera&quot;&gt;SLR&lt;/a&gt; camera for enthusiasts and professionals.  With the point-and-shoot camera, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_balance&quot;&gt;white balance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-stop&quot;&gt;f-stop&lt;/a&gt; or any of a bunch of other technical aspects of photography.  I simply point it at what I want to take a picture of and click the button.  On the other end of the spectrum, there are the SLR cameras where I may not need to know those things in order to take a picture &amp;hellip; but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hide those things from me either.  The point-and-shoot camera is an appliance.  The SLR camera is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does a general computing appliance look like?  Simply enough, it looks like the iPhone or iPad as far as the way it operates.  With these devices, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know about files or folders or networks.  You turn it on, download an app and perform a task.  Everything else is taken care of for you.  Does this mean you can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;calculate, with accuracy, the trajectory of a rocket shot to the moon, and the amount of fuel it needs to get there&amp;rdquo;?  Of course not, but you do need an app for that &amp;hellip; which someone else must have made for you.  Does it mean that you can&amp;rsquo;t connect a Wacom tablet and do cool, unspecified things with Adobe Illustrator?  Well, for now, yes &amp;hellip; but the concept of a general computing appliance doesn&amp;rsquo;t preclude this.  A general computing appliance is something for consumers and will hide the implementation details of how the computer works, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it can&amp;rsquo;t do powerful things or allow one to attach peripherals such as a Wacom tablet or a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s where we get to files, the big argument amongst my friends was that files are the glue between applications that are never perfect.  A file allows one to take data that was created by one application that does part of the task I want to another application that allows me to finish the task.  The implicit fear is that on a general computing appliance, apps will turn into data islands that do not allow me to perform this kind of assembly-line workflow that the desktop PC has enabled since its inception.  If you look at the iPhone, this is mostly the case.  One app&amp;rsquo;s data is not shared to any other apps, with the exception of some built-in applications like the camera and the photos app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Android, it is a different story.  Android has a system whereby one application can serve up its data to the rest of the device via a content provider system.  This allows any application on the device to integrate with the built-in contacts application, or the photo gallery application.  It allows new applications to serve new kinds of data and control how that data can be accessed or changed.  This system also does not resort to sharing files.  It is an OS-controlled communication protocol that allows an application to have its own data strongly protected but also affords sharing.  This type of system is what will allow for files and folders to truly become an implementation detail on consumer-level general computing appliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my idea of what the general computing appliance nirvana looks like from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A way to download, install and uninstall applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A means of launching an application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system whereby installed applications can notify the user of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A means of switching between running applications and controlling what applications are running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system of configuring the settings of applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a general computing appliance should afford the following without the user having to be involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing of data between applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to the device&amp;rsquo;s peripherals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other integration points between applications (a la Intents in Android).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s about it as far as a consumer is concerned.  This is the genius behind the iPhone and why I believe it will be considered revolutionary in the years to come.  It was the first true general computing appliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave the desktop PC?  Should it get more respect or should it become the computing world&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield&quot;&gt;Rodney Dangerfield&lt;/a&gt;?  I partially agree with Mr. Dvorak here.  The traditional desktop PC will continue to have its place in the computing future.  But it will belong to enthusiasts and professionals, not to the consumer.  The people who are writing apps for consumer devices will use a desktop PC (or the future&amp;rsquo;s version of it).  The people who are doing more free-form computing tasks will likely use a desktop PC, perhaps engineers or scientists or data miners, people who aren&amp;rsquo;t performing the same task all the time.  I believe though that over time the set of people that use what we now call the desktop PC environment will shrink slowly but inevitably.  As operating systems evolve and developers begin to understand more of what people actually use computers for, we will be able to simplify more tasks to the level of an appliance.  It does not mean the end of the enthusiast or the professional, simply that one does not have to be an enthusiast or professional to get the benefit of the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not something to be reviled, but something to be considered natural.  It is the march of progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the knob that just has some mysterious single-digit numbers on it or the never-explained &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;colder&amp;rdquo; labels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to a camera used for video, which I feel still tend to be less on the appliance side.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref2&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>The Perfect IDE</title>
   <link href="http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/07/10/the-perfect-ide/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-10T13:35:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/07/10/the-perfect-ide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a bunch of code lately for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.android.com&quot;&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; project I&amp;rsquo;m working on.  What this means is that I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing Java code in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org&quot;&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;.  The Java part isn&amp;rsquo;t bad, though coming from C# and .NET there are a lot of things that I miss.  But that isn&amp;rsquo;t what this is about &amp;hellip; this about IDEs, Integrated Development Environments.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland&quot;&gt;Borland&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Turbo products, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal&quot;&gt;Turbo Pascal&lt;/a&gt; being my introduction to the company, were the first ever IDEs, but they were probably pretty close.  Back in those days, one needed an IDE because computers could only run one program at a time &amp;hellip; so running an editor, then leaving it to compile, then running a debugger, etc was all a big pain.  Now, computers are never running just one program &amp;hellip; and even programs are doing multiple things at once.  My phone, right now, has a couple programs running on it with at least seven threads each.  But I digress &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we don&amp;rsquo;t need IDEs anymore.  Why do we still have them?  Because opening one program that keeps track of all the minutia of writing code is a good thing.  It knows which files belong to the project so when one needs to build the project, it just takes one click (sometimes not even that) and it&amp;rsquo;s done.  When there is an error in the build, one can simply click the error message and the offending place in the offending file is displayed for easy fixing.  There are all these little things that the IDE helps with that one simply can&amp;rsquo;t get from a set of command-line SDK-style tools and an editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem with most IDEs is that you can&amp;rsquo;t have just one.  I currently have five installed.  I have Visual Studio 2008 for working with older .NET projects.  I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio 2010&lt;/a&gt; for working on newer .NET projects.  I have the built-in PowerShell Integrated Shell Environment for PowerShell scripting.  I have Eclipse for working on Android projects and I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/a&gt; because a friend recommended I check it out also for Android projects.  Why do I have to have all these different IDEs installed?  Because Visual Studio is best for .NET projects, Eclipse has the tools I need for Android, the PowerShell ISE is the only thing that has syntax highlighting for PowerShell.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on why I need two copies of Visual Studio &amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s just extra stupid.  Could I use Eclipse for .NET projects?  Maybe, but the amount of work it would take to make that happen is just scary.  I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure that coercing Visual Studio into doing Android development is even possible.  IntelliJ seems to only be an IDE for Java, so using it for anything else is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, essentially, the Perfect IDE means I only have to have one.  With it, I can write code for any language and platform and have all the tools I expect to have at my disposal.  Let&amp;rsquo;s go over those, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editor

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Font selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Color syntax highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible formatting support (brace style, etc) where the editor automatically formats my code as I type&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intelligent completion (like IntelliSense in Visual Studio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search and replace including regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactoring tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project support

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some way of knowing what files, objects, etc are in the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy navigation to any project item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-click build (or background building if it works reliably)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breakpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expression evaluation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Window manager

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support multiple top-level windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows me to move any view group to any window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows me to dock any view group to one particular area of a window&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views can include a file in the editor, project explorer, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the &lt;strong&gt;bare minimum&lt;/strong&gt; of what I expect from an IDE because this is what most IDEs get mostly right. Some additional features that most IDEs do not get right or don&amp;rsquo;t offer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source control integration

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most IDEs have support for one or two source control packages, but they rarely are the one I&amp;rsquo;m using at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build integration

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most IDEs have their own built-in build tool, but they rarely make it easy to support advanced build tools such as Ant or MSBuild.  IDEs should get out of the build business and use these advanced build tools by generating the required files and letting the build tool do the work.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Studio gets this kind of right, but there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of stuff that&amp;rsquo;s done behind the scenes that makes it worthless if you try to use their generated stuff outside the IDE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse supposedly gets this right in that it uses Ant internally, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any Ant build files until I generated them myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for multiple languages and platforms

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How hard is this?!?  The process of editing, compiling and debugging has been set in stone for decades.  Heck, even the syntax of most languages is becoming more and more similar &amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s C-derived syntax and everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make adding new languages drop-dead easy.  I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to add just color-syntax highlighting for PowerShell to a couple IDEs and it is a huge pain, if possible at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML support

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First-class support just like any other language with syntax highlighting, formatting support and intelligent completion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data visualization for well-known formats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI generation tools

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is something I can understand most IDEs not having support for a bunch of platforms because developing UI is very different even within a platform such as Windows, let alone across platforms.  Though with the advent of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Application_Markup_Language&quot;&gt;XAML&lt;/a&gt; and similar technologies, I see convergence happening here too in the coming years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s my laundry list.  How is this achieved?  That&amp;rsquo;s a great question.  I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IDEs need to realize their main job is window and plugin management.  The IDE is simply there to mediate the interactions between various plugins that do the heavy lifting and provide windows that let the developer see what the plugins are doing for them.  I think what keeps IDE makers from seeing this is that every IDE includes, by definition, an editor.  So they write an editor first and then start tacking on all this other functionality and then they have an IDE.  Yes, even the editor should just be a plugin.  And I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to be stuck with just one editor plugin.  Maybe I want one for XML and a different one for Java and yet another for C#.  I&amp;rsquo;m a developer, I&amp;rsquo;m choosy like that!  Multiple installed plugins for all services should be the norm, not the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m asking for too much.  Maybe what we&amp;rsquo;d end up with if someone actually made what I&amp;rsquo;m asking for is something similar to Eclipse with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/&quot;&gt;eleven different versions&lt;/a&gt; to choose from and no help for someone just wanting to get some work done.  Maybe we&amp;rsquo;d end up with crazy, incomprehensible configuration dialogs (though pretty much every IDE has at least one of those already).  I think it is possible though.  I really believe it can be done right given the right vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone want to prove me right?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why I'm Considering Dumping Facebook for Google Buzz</title>

   <id>http://www.lee-dohm.com/2010/07/08/why-im-considering-dumping-facebook-for-google-buzz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the various Facebook privacy debates and I&amp;rsquo;ve been just as concerned as many people, but the reality, or so I thought, is that there weren&amp;rsquo;t other good options. I really like being able to update all of my friends, family and extended acquaintances on (not so) significant happenings in my life in one easy motion. I like being able to easily share stuff like pictures, videos, links and commentary with these same people. I enjoy posting nonsensical musings that might make people smile, but if people don&amp;rsquo;t have time &amp;hellip; they don&amp;rsquo;t even have to delete them from their inbox. As far as I knew, there weren&amp;rsquo;t other worthwhile&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; sites that offered that kind of functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Google Buzz came out to fanfare quickly followed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/warning-google-buzz-has-a-huge-privacy-flaw-2010-2&quot;&gt;privacy issues of their own&lt;/a&gt;, I was immediately turned off and vowed to not consider the product, let alone use it.  But lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been perusing Google&amp;rsquo;s offerings for various reasons and well, it was right there, so I fiddled about with it.  I checked their privacy policy.  I checked the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/dashboard&quot;&gt;Google Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, where one can see everything that Google has associated with your profile &amp;hellip; manage the privacy settings and in the case of Buzz, delete all content with just a few clicks.  And Google Buzz lets you easily do everything that Facebook can do and some other things besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the breakdown of why I&amp;rsquo;m strongly considering using Google Buzz as my social network framework of choice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily control who can see what entries I create on Google Buzz.  I can make something public to the entire Internet, assign one or more groups or even just one person as able to view and comment on my posts on a post-by-post basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Visibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can easily see what items can be seen by whom.  Through the Google Dashboard I can see everything that Google has connected me with and why.  I can then make informed decisions on how I use the service rather than relying on word-of-mouth and the latest Internet scare to tell me what Facebook has exposed to outsiders this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Anonymity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not using this particular feature but it is well known that Facebook doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow accounts with anything other than your &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; first and last name with an optional nickname (but only if it is a variation of your first name) or maiden name.  On Google Buzz, I could create a new Google Account for any of the various gaming names I&amp;rsquo;ve held over the years and post as that identity, if I was so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, what all this boils down to is a question of control.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated that in his opinion, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/11/facebooks-zuckerberg-the_n_417969.html&quot;&gt;the expectation of privacy is no longer a social norm&lt;/a&gt;.  Because of this, he decided to change Facebook&amp;rsquo;s policies to match his vision of the current trend in social norms.  While I applaud him for taking his company in a bold direction, something most CEOs will not do.  I&amp;rsquo;d rather that access to my information be controlled by my vision of social norms.  As far as I can tell, Google Buzz gives me that control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know about LinkedIn, Friendster, MySpace and the like.  LinkedIn is designed for business networking.  Friendster I can&amp;rsquo;t even go to their main page without signing in.  And if you think MySpace is a serious site, comment after you get your driver&amp;rsquo;s license.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
