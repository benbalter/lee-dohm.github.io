Recently, [Blizzard's][blizzard] [Diablo III][d3] in-game economy suffered a huge malfunction that was caused, presumably, by [an integer overflow bug][bug]. This bug allegedly crept in when a last-minute change was added to a release where a limiting constant was raised from 1 million to 10 million. I wanted to take this opportunity, not to rub Blizzard's nose in it, but to talk about something that most people don't talk about: how to construct tests that keep your system covered as much as possible when the system is changed.

The basic rundown of the bug is this:

1. Create an auction of 6 billion gold.
1. Auction shows up as 1,705,032,704 gold with *only that much deducted from your account*.
1. Cancel the auction.
1. Find 6 billion gold refunded to your account.

And, as the meme goes, PROFIT!
