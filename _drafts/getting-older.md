When I was young and still in school, I had what appeared to be an [eidetic, or photographic, memory][eidetic]. I did things like recalled events in exacting detail from years previously, in my high school English class I recalled the exact definition of the word "primordial" from when I looked it up three years before,^(1) and to spite my Biology teacher who was, in turn, trying to spite me for not doing my homework, I recited the categories of bones in the body from looking at a diagram for about three seconds. As I've gotten older though, these events became less and less frequent. It appeared that ability had faded. And in the past few years, I had thought it had gone for good.
