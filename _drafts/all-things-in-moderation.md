As some of you know, I'm currently the main moderator on [Discuss][discuss], the official [Atom][atom] editor forum. It is a smallish message board in the grand scheme of things with an average of about sixty users visiting per day and about 150 posts in a week. I was invited to be a moderator in early March of 2014, so last year was a lot of learning about how to nudge, shape and mold a community ... and get over myself.

Being a moderator is not just about having the [banhammer][banhammer], it's about setting an example. As moderator, you have to essentially be the best possible kind of forum participant. At all times you have to:

* Encourage Discussion
* Encourage Constructive Discussion
* Be a Guidepost
* Be the Gardener
* Be the Janitor
* Know When to Shut the Hell Up

## Encourage Discussion

Talking about things is the lifeblood of a message board, so encouraging people to talk is kind of obvious. What sometimes isn't obvious is *how*. One can do this by [coming up with new ideas][ideas] and tossing them out half formed to see where other people go with it. Or simply by just inviting other members to join conversations they haven't yet and share their thoughts.[^at-mentions]

## Encourage *Constructive* Discussion

By recognizing when conversations have gotten off the rails and nudging them back on-course, but also completely reformulating the forum topic sometimes.

## Be a Guidepost

Mostly by being the master of the search feature :laughing:

## Be the Gardener

Sometimes you have to pull weeds.

## Be the Janitor

## Know When to Shut the Hell Up



[^at-mentions]: The at-mentions feature of [Discourse][discourse] is a great feature for doing this.
