I saw [this post][post] on [Reddit][reddit] today and I felt like I wanted to say something about my personal driving philosophy. I've lived in a few different places in the country in my life: the California Central Valley, Silicon Valley, the Greater Seattle Area, and rural Washington state. I even spent enough time in Phoenix and Detroit that I feel like I can say that I lived there even if only a short time.[^1] The common thread in all of these places is that everyone that lives there thinks that the worst drivers in the country only live right there where they live. The fact of the matter is that the worst drivers in the country live everywhere ... so there is nowhere you can go to escape them. What you can do is mitigate their impact with Lee Dohm's Rules for Reduced Stress Driving.

They are:

1. Leave Earlier
1. Increase Your Follow Distance
1. If People Around You Are Driving Crazy, Drive Even Safer
1. Learn to Be Happy With the Slow Lane

But before I get into what the rules actually mean and why they are useful, I wanted to talk a little about why I cobbled them together in the first place. I grew up in California and

## Leave Earlier

## Increase Your Follow Distance

## If People Around You Are Driving Crazy, Drive Even More Safely

## Learn to be Happy with the Slow Lane

[^1]: I spent one week out of every four for a year in each of Phoenix and Detroit when I was doing contract work.
