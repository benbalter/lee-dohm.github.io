[The NSA is demanding, and getting, records of *all* calls within the US][eff]. This is where the slippery slope of the [Patriot Act][patriot] leads. This is like what happens with a child when you say, "No cake until after dinner," but then relent and say, "Oh well since you did so well in school today you can have cake before dinner." The child naturally starts thinking that when you draw a line, it's not a real line, it's all negotiable.
