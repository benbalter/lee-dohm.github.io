So ... how do we solve gentrification?

Tell people they can't buy or rent where they want? "Sorry, you make too much money to live in this perfectly fine neighborhood."

Tell people they can't sell their property for the best price they can get for it? "Whoa whoa whoa ... you can't sell that house for $150k. I don't care what they offered you. You're not allowed to sell it for a dime over $130k ... we have your former neighbors to think about."

What is really "forcing" the original residents out? Is it that the older residents pass away and their children (living somewhere else) sell their house? I don't see anything wrong with that.

Or is it property taxes that is forcing original residents out? As more and more affluent people move into a neighborhood, paying more money for properties and driving up the housing costs ... are absolute property taxes (as opposed to property tax rates) rising? According to [this very helpful document](http://bainbridgeislandferrytails.com/docs/how%20washington%20state%20property%20tax%20works.pdf), the average absolute property tax for a given area only goes up if the budget for that tax district goes up. So, based on how property tax works in Washington state, it wouldn't seem to be *only* the fact that housing prices are going up that would push property taxes up.

I agree that people who want to keep living someplace where they own the property shouldn't be forced out. But I don't see a bunch of tech workers petitioning the government to use eminent domain to take over Capitol Hill.
