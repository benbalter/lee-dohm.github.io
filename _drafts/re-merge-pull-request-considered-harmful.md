I recently was pointed to the article ["Merge pull request" Considered Harmful][harmful] by [@thomasjo][thomasjo], someone I'm working with on [a package for Atom][atom-overrides]. And I have to say, it did make me think. You see, I'm generally an advocate for the status quo when I'm confronted with anything new in programming. It is a bad habit, but one that I am working on. So, any new idea like using `git am` instead of the "Merge Pull Request" button on GitHub as suggested by this article has an uphill battle to fight in my mind, typically. This time it was no different.

But, like I say, I'm trying to work on this bad habit of mine. So I sat down and thought of the pros and cons on this particular thing and then did a lot of browsing of the [hub utility][hub] manpage. Here is what I came up with:

* Pros
    * Speeds up merges of new functionality
* Cons
    * Uses an unfamiliar command
    *
