I spent the majority of the New Year's weekend playing the new [Star Wars Massively Multiplayer Online Game](http://www.swtor.com), colloquially referred to by its acronym, SWTOR.  It is by [BioWare](http://www.bioware.com), newly acquired by [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com).  BioWare is the game company behind many PC- and console-based role-playing games including the Baldur's Gate series, Jade Empire, the Mass Effect series and, of course, the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic single-player game.  If it's a role-playing game made by BioWare, I just buy it because I know it is going to be great.

One of the hallmarks of BioWare's games of the last several years is that many quests present moral choices, that one is free to solve the situation either the "good" way or the "bad" way and those choices generally have consequences.  This lends itself particularly well to the Star Wars concept of the Light and Dark Sides of the Force.  Another, more controversial, hallmark of BioWare's recent games is that they all allowed for romantic plotlines of both hetero- and homosexual variations.  I don't know if SWTOR will follow this pattern, but I would not be surprised.  But, it is this freedom to be the character you want to be that has lent an extra level of depth to BioWare's games and made me take a second look at SWTOR even though I've been burnt out on MMO games for a few years now.

Why did I stop playing MMO games?  Because the challenge was gone.  There was nothing new about them, really, since World of Warcraft was released.  Prior to WoW, there was very little innovation after EverQuest.  EQ and WoW solidified the "Holy Trinity" of Tank, DPS and Healer as the mechanism of MMO combat.  Virtually every combat came down to an equation of the rate at which the Tank took damage minus the rate at which the Healer could heal damage versus the rate at which the DPS could deal damage to the enemy against the number of hit points the enemy had.  If the DPS could reduce the enemy's hit points to zero before the Tank's hit points reached zero, you won.  If not, you lost.  After playing EQ for five years and then WoW for another three (and dabbling in or beta testing virtually every other MMO that came out in that time frame), I had seen all the possible variations.  I was bored.

WoW revitalized my interest after burning out on EQ because it innovated in a few ways, but for the most part it was a less buggy MMO.  What I was really hoping for was for someone to come along and shake things up, make things interesting again.  What I thought I was hoping for was someone to come up with something other than the Holy Trinity.  Some new mechanic to make combat interesting again.  I'm happy to say that I was wrong.  From my experience with SWTOR and raising four classes to tenth level, it seems that BioWare is just fine leaving the Holy Trinity intact.  They decided to innovate in other ways.  They decided to make the story important again ...
