I've worked in a few places that have made a lot of software. Companies that make so much software that there are corporation-wide systems for reading, writing, storing, building and sometimes deploying code. When you have huge teams all working on the same project, reducing the overhead of certain activities can create a huge savings in developer time. A couple of the most common are how to get the source code and how to build the code. One of the companies I worked for had a system that dated back years and years called "Build Windows", icons you clicked on to open a specially-configured command-line session that would allow one to build the code properly.
