I came out to my friends and family earlier this year.  I had converted to using a Mac and soon afterward powered down my Windows-based PC for good.  Why did I do this after my over twenty-year love affair with the PC?  Sure, I dabbled with [OS/2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) and [BeOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS) and even at one point in college (along with my dear friend Punish) declared [BSD Unix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Unix) to be the victor in our own personal computer operating system showdown.  But I always built my own desktops from pieces I had chosen myself.  And when none of those operating systems proved to be able to unseat Windows, Windows always welcomed me back with open arms.  Each time, I was glad to be home.

So what happened?  Why now?  Lots of people choose the Apple hardware to run Windows, why wasn't that an option?  There are a lot of little reasons, but I think they build up into one big reason.  I'm going to try to distill it and get it across in this blog post.  It was a process of discovery that started when I tried out the iPhone and bought a Mac Mini to write apps for the iPhone and culminated in me turning off my once-beloved PC.

Some of the little reasons first ...

## Gesture Support

I thought nothing would ever unseat a mouse with a wheel as the best pointing device ever.  But when I started fiddling around with a Mac I decided to try out the [Magic Trackpad](http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/).  I've found the gesture support enabled by the trackpad to be far more intuitive than a mouse with a wheel.  Not only can I scroll webpages with a simple two-finger swipe.  I can navigate forward or back between pages of information with a two-finger swipe, or pan around a photo with two fingers, or switch between full-screen applications with three fingers.

## OS-Wide Spellcheck and Auto-Correct

In Windows, spellcheck and auto-correct are application by application features.  This means that you have to tell it, "No, my last name is not misspelled," fifteen times before all the applications get the message.  On OS X, all applications share the same spelling and auto-correct features provided by the OS.    It is very simple and convenient.

## Automatically Remembers Volume Levels

I figured this one out on my Mac laptop.  I was at work and therefore had the volume muted.  But I wanted to watch a video link that someone sent me, so I plugged in my headphones.  I watched the video and then unplugged my headphones.  It wasn't until a few minutes later that I realized that when I plugged in my headphones, the sound was unmuted and set to my normal volume and when I unplugged them again the sound was again muted automatically.  This just makes sense.

## Better Designed Hardware

I've custom-built my own PCs using parts that I've selected by hand for almost twenty years.  I have always had exactly the machine I wanted and very convenient for me.  But they required a lot of work, and they've been big, hulking, noisy machines.  Apple machines, both laptops and desktops, have the hardware that I would design into them, but are designed elegantly, simply, require fewer cables and aren't noisy.  All Apple machines include Wi-Fi.  All Apple machines include Bluetooth.  Almost all Apple machines have a webcam.  (Actually, let me rephrase, all Apple monitors have a webcam ... including the ones built into their laptops.)  Why do they include these things?  Because it makes them better ... and why wouldn't you?  Apple doesn't feel the need to skimp on things to save a few bucks here and there.

## A More Controlled Experience

This heading may sound scary to you.  And it would have once to me as well.  But I once heard in high school (and then repeated often and loudly) that a dictatorship is the most efficient form of government and that an enlightened dictator would then probably be the best government Man could have.  (In high school, I of course imagined myself as the dictator in question because who else knew everything?)  But we deal with dictatorships all the time.  The cellular phone companies are an example.  We are allowed to use their networks, but only when we pay the right amount and use the networks in the way we are allowed.  It is only the amount of benevolence or enlightenment that makes these dictatorships easier or harder to work with.

It is true that the Apple ecosystem is, in large part, a [walled garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walled_garden_(technology)).  But, I feel that the Apple ecosystem is designed to be beneficial in large part to its users.  Most other ecosystems are designed to be beneficial solely to its creators or operators.  Let's take application curation as an example.

Who benefits from keeping bad apps from an application store such as the Mac App Store, the iOS App Store or the Android App Store?  The user does surely because they can download apps without fear.  Does the curator benefit?  Perhaps.  But curation is a huge cost.  Each application and every update must be scrutinized by, presumably, both automated and manual processes.  So the curator must spend a lot of resources for the benefit enjoyed mostly by the user.

Who benefits from fewer apps in an application store?  The user benefits if the apps that are allowed in are of the same variety, similar cost and of generally higher quality.  The curator benefits if the apps that are allowed in bring in more revenue.  But once again, the curation process is a huge cost.

Who benefits from an application store that will allow any application with as few restrictions as possible?  The user is taking the risk of downloading malicious applications.  The user has to judge quality for themselves using their own time and money.  The user has to be their own curator.  The owner of the application store benefits from allowing in all applications because they have an application store without the overwhelming cost of curation.  The owner benefits because users and volunteers like security researchers will find the bad apps and notify the owner who can then take corrective action reactively.

Apple's customer is you.  Microsoft's customer is the enterprise.

Let's start with the hardware ...

Life with a PC has always meant a rat's nest of cables behind my desk.  Each time I need to change out a peripheral such as a monitor it means I'm going to have to go spelunking through a bazillion dust-covered cables and untangle them so I can extricate the peripheral from the morass of plasticized rubber and wiring back there.  Macs just don't need as many cables.  Apple has done its best to make as many things wireless as possible and where not possible, reduce the number of discrete cables needed.  Every single one of their desktop machines includes Wi-Fi so you don't need network cables.  All of them support Bluetooth so you don't need keyboard or mouse cables.  I was able to get rid of five cables (power, right- and left-speaker, signal and volume control puck) by switching to the Apple LED Cinema display which includes quite decent speakers built right in.  I was able to get rid of the audio signal cable because DisplayPort (much like HDMI, but smaller) carries the audio signal too.

But its not just the cables.  The hardware is just better as well.  I used a [Shuttle PC](http://us.shuttle.com/R4_6100.aspx) for a year or so and thought that was the pinnacle of computing engineering at the time.  Until both of mine broke down within a year or so of each other.  But look at the dimensions of the computer I linked to.  The Mac Mini is 10.5% of the size of the Shuttle and only 25% of the weight.  And the Mac Mini can do everything the Shuttle PC can do, looks better and is 70% of the price.  Yes, the Apple product is cheaper!

As a matter of fact, this is something I've noticed more and more lately.  Apple products don't try to compete on the super-low-end of the price spectrum, but that doesn't mean that they aren't priced competitively in the areas of the spectrum where they do try to compete.

But let's move on to software, specifically the Mac operating system, [OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X) ...

I won't spend a lot of time boring you with the history of Unix and Linux other than to remind you that for a long time people spent a lot of effort attempting to replace Windows with a "kinder, gentler" Linux.  A Linux that even one's mother or [Aunt Tillie](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html) could use!  Some people claim they succeeded.  Some claim they didn't.  The goal was to make a version of Unix that was approachable to the masses. OS X is that operating system.

Everything underneath the covers of OS X is Unix-based.  This means that the operating system is powerful and works according to standards that have had decades to be designed, vetted, tested and reworked.  Everything on top is designed to be easy for the "average user".  And in between, there is plenty of glue to make things easily customizable.  Apple succeeded where hordes of open source developers arguably failed.

For me, this is very important.  I've always respected Unix as an operating system.  I've always been envious of all the powerful utilities that seem to be made for programmers over there.  But I've never wanted to deal with the day-in-day-out crap of configuration files and command lines and just bad user interface design I've seen on Linux.  Now, I don't have to make that choice.  OS X and the software that runs on it is, in general, well-designed and easy to use.  And at the same time, I have those powerful Unix roots that I can access at a moment's notice.  Power when I need it.  Ease of use when I don't.

But overall, the thing that I believe will keep me on the Mac are the things that transcend the hardware and the software ...

Little touches throughout the system ... like the fact that on the Mac laptops there are no buttons next to the trackpad.  The trackpad is a button that clicks to let you know when you've triggered it.  That little bit of tactile feedback is worth more than you might think.  Like how I had my laptop speakers muted at work when I was in the bullpen so I didn't disturb my fellow workers, but as soon as I plug in headphones the mute automatically turns off and just as automatically turns on when I unplug them.  Like the [MagSafe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe) laptop charging connector.  Like the operating-system-wide spell checker and auto-corrector.  And a whole host of other things ...

What it all boils down to, I believe, is that Apple is willing to take risks and push things forward.  And since Apple controls both the hardware and the software, they are able to push things forward in unique ways that Microsoft is incapable of doing.  But, sadly, I think Apple is just more willing to take some risks and make things better in ways that might not be popular at first, but they know will grow on people over time.  And I say "sadly" because I believe that this is something that Microsoft is unwilling to do anymore.
