In the past few weeks there have been a lot of words written, talks given, tweets twittered and ideas spread around the concepts of feminism, corruption in games journalism, misogyny and outright violence against women. To be honest, I was content to let women fight for their rights and for the longest time I thought that me just not standing in their way was enough. This was comfortable for me. I didn't have to get involved in issues I knew I didn't understand completely or maybe couldn't relate to on a visceral level as someone who has grown up as an upper-middle-class white American male. But as the saying goes, all it takes for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing. So, I've decided to take a stand.

I'll start by saying, first and foremost, violence is *not* okay. This includes violence against any group simply because of their membership in a group. This includes women, minorities, immigrants, religious groups (Islam, Christianity, Seventh Day Adventists ... even Scientology and Mormons), socialists, communists, nationalities, gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders, the disabled and challenged ... and probably lots of other groups I haven't included.

The only time violence is the least bit justified is to prevent violence from being perpetrated upon yourself or the people who are in your charge to protect. This does *not* include pre-emptive violence ... "I'm'a gonna do unto them before they do unto me" is *not* okay.

Physical and psychological violence
