title: New Features That All Future Software Should Include
tags: Geeky
---

At first, I didn't give much thought to "the cloud". I thought it was just some new management fad like "tiger teams" or "total quality management". But then I tried out [Google Chrome][chrome] just to see how it compared to the other browsers and I found a feature that made me think about the cloud in a whole new way.

Google Chrome has a feature where, if you sign in with a free Google account, it will synchronize not only your bookmarks, but your plugins, preferences, themes, even your account passwords. Ever since I noticed and made use of this feature, pretty much every other program I use on a daily basis has been annoying me. Between work and home, I have two main computers: my home machine and my work machine. Both of these computers has almost exactly the same set of applications on it and there are a few applications that get very heavy use. I find myself asking lately why I have to manually configure them to work the same? Why do I have to manually keep them all patched? Why do I have to manually install the same extensions? Essentially, why do I have to manually set up my working environment twice and then work hard to maintain it between the two computers? Google Chrome showed me that I don't have to. So here is what I expect of all new applications:

## Don't Make Me Deal With Updates

Automatic updates are cool. [Windows][windows] led the way with automatic updates where it would download the update for you automatically, let you know that it was ready to install and give you the choice of allowing the update to go ahead or telling it to wait. Unfortunately, the average user isn't really qualified to make that decision and if the update comes at a bothersome time, they'll most often tell the update to wait.

But look at it from the user's perspective. They come home from a tough day at the office or a long day running errands on the weekend. They sit down at their computer to just check some email before watching the latest reality show, "Dancing with Washed Up Stars on Ice in Space" and the computer says, "Hey wait! I need your help with something! Pay attention here! Make a decision!" Isn't that irritating? Those of us who are parents will recognize this pattern as that of a little kid. You put up with it ... mostly ... because they're your child. We don't want to deal with it from our computer. And if the update is already downloaded, why couldn't it just install it while I was away? Why do I have to wait for my computer to reboot when it could have taken care of it when I didn't need to do something?!? Computers suck!!!

We computer people make such a fuss about how much more we get done with computers, but because most of us are such control freaks we don't realize that the majority of computer users don't care where the file is on the hard drive as long as they can find it. Or when exactly the file gets saved to the disk as long as they don't lose work. Or which version of the application they're running exactly as long as it has the features they want.

So when an update becomes available, the application should simply download the update and install it without asking the user. This does not mean pop up in the middle of what the user is doing and tell them to stop working so you can install an update. This means that the application should continue functioning completely as normal and at most let the user know that when they feel like it they can restart the application to get the new features. Google Chrome does this perfectly. Even the flag to let you know that you should restart Chrome is completely unobtrusive.

This leads us to the next level ...

## Don't Make Me Configure You

I think I first noticed this when dealing with programming environments. Software developers are such a persnickety lot that code editors, IDEs and the like generally have **huge** settings systems with tons upon tons of configuration options. The editor that I use currently, [Sublime Text][sublime], simply gave up on having preferences screens and is completely configured through text files. Because there are so many settings for these programs, keeping two environments in sync is an impossible task. But even with regular software, like an email program, it is pretty tough if you're using anything but the defaults.

Now, it's all well and good to point out that the majority of our settings are the same in different environments. But there are some cases where we do not want to share *all* settings. For example, on my email programs I might not want to configure them for the same accounts. My work email client should only check my work email and my home email client should only check my home email. But all the other settings could easily be shared because I'm probably going to work exactly the same or very similarly other than what email accounts to check.
