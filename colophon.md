# Colophon

> **noun.** a statement at the end of a book, typically with a printer's emblem, giving information about its authorship and printing.

Why yes, it does seem rather hipster of me to include a colophon on my blog. On the other hand, the colophon at the end of [O'Reilly][oreilly] books was always something that interested me and seemed cool.[^bbatsov] So, here's mine ...

I use [Jekyll][jekyll], the blog-aware static site generator, to generate the content of the site from a bunch of text files.[^text-files]

I write all of the articles in [Sublime Text 3][sublime] and publish them via [git][git] to [GitHub Pages][pages]. I write everything on my 27" iMac running OS X Mountain Lion. I use the [das Keyboard Professional for Mac][das-keyboard] for all my typing.

I'm using the [Leap Day theme][theme] by [Matt Graham][matt-graham] with only minor tweaks to make Gists look correct and other personal touches.

All of the source code for the site is available on [GitHub][source].

[^bbatsov]: And I saw it on [Bozhidar Batsov's site][bbatsov].
[^text-files]: Although, the content of the site, with the exception of a very few images, is just a bunch of text files anyway. So really, it just converts a bunch of text files of one type into a bunch of text files of another type. I'm going to stop talking now before I suck all the magic out of it.
