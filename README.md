# This is the data for my blog

My blog can be found at [www.lee-dohm.com](http://www.lee-dohm.com). It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

## Workflow

1. Execute `rake draft title="Sample Title"` to create a draft article
1. Write, proofread and rewrite until satisfied
1. Execute `rake publish title="Sample Title"` to convert the draft into a post
1. Commit and push to the `source` branch
1. Execute `rake push` to generate the site content and push the updated content to the website
